vkFreeMemory(3)
===============

Name
----
vkFreeMemory - Free GPU memory

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkFreeMemory Free GPU memory

To free a memory object, call:

include::../protos/vkFreeMemory.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the memory.
  * pname:memory is the sname:VkDeviceMemory object to be freed.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in
    the <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.


Description
-----------

Before freeing a memory object, an application must: ensure the
memory object is no longer in use by the device--for example by command
buffers queued for execution. The memory can: remain bound to images or
buffers at the time the memory object is freed, but any further use of them
(on host or device) for anything other than destroying those objects will
result in undefined behavior. If there are still any bound images or
buffers, the memory may: not be immediately released by the implementation,
but must: be released by the time all bound images and buffers have been
destroyed. Once memory is released, it is returned to the heap from which it
was allocated.

How memory objects are bound to Images and Buffers is described in detail in
the <<resources-association, Resource Memory Association>> section.

If a memory object is mapped at the time it is freed, it is implicitly
unmapped.
