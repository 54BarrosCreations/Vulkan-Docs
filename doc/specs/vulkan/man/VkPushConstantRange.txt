VkPushConstantRange(3)
======================

Name
----
VkPushConstantRange - Structure specifying a push constant range

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkPushConstantRange - Structure specifying a push constant range

The sname:VkPushConstantRange structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkPushConstantRange.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:stageFlags is a set of stage flags describing the shader
    stages that will access a range of push constants. If a particular stage
    is not included in the range, then accessing members of that range of
    push constants from the corresponding shader stage will result in
    undefined data being read.
  * pname:offset and pname:size are the start offset and size,
    respectively, consumed by the range. Both pname:offset and pname:size
    are in units of bytes and must: be a multiple of 4. The layout of
    the push constant variables is specified in the shader.
