VkImageView - Opaque handle to a image view object

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkImageView - Opaque handle to a image view object

Image objects are not directly accessed by pipeline shaders for reading or
writing image data. Instead, _image views_ representing contiguous ranges of
the image subresources and containing additional metadata are used for that
purpose. Views must: be created on images of compatible types, and must:
represent a valid subset of image subresources.

Image views are represented by sname:VkImageView handles:
