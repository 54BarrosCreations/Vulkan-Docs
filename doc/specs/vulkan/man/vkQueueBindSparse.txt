vkQueueBindSparse(3)
====================

Name
----
vkQueueBindSparse - Bind device memory to a sparse resource object.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkQueueBindSparse Bind device memory to a sparse resource object.

To submit sparse binding operations to a queue, call:

include::../protos/vkQueueBindSparse.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:queue is the queue that the sparse binding operations will be submitted to.
  * pname:bindInfoCount is the number of elements in the pname:pBindInfo array.
  * pname:pBindInfo is an array of slink:VkBindSparseInfo structures,
    each specifying a sparse binding submission batch.
  * pname:fence is an optional handle to a fence to be signaled. If
    pname:fence is not dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE, it defines a
    <<synchronization-fences-signaling, fence signal operation>>.


Description
-----------

fname:vkQueueBindSparse is a
<<devsandqueues-submission,queue submission command>>, with each batch
defined by an element of pname:pBindInfo as an instance of the
slink:VkBindSparseInfo structure.

Within a batch, a given range of a resource must: not be bound more than
once. Across batches, if a range is to be bound to one allocation and offset
and then to another allocation and offset, then the application must:
guarantee (usually using semaphores) that the binding operations are
executed in the correct order, as well as to order binding operations
against the execution of command buffer submissions.

As no operation to flink:vkQueueBindSparse causes any pipeline stage to
access memory, synchronization primitives used in this command effectively
only define execution dependencies.

Additional information about fence and semaphore operation is described in
<<synchronization, the synchronization chapter>>.
