C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCreateXcbSurfaceKHR - Create a slink:VkSurfaceKHR object for a X11 window, using the XCB client-side library

Parameters
----------

  * pname:instance is the instance to associate the surface with.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    sname:VkXcbSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure containing parameters
    affecting the creation of the surface object.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
