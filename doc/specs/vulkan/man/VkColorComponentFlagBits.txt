VkColorComponentFlagBits(3)
===========================

Name
----
VkColorComponentFlagBits - Bitmask controlling which components are written to the framebuffer

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkColorComponentFlagBits - Bitmask controlling which components are written to the framebuffer

The pname:colorWriteMask member of slink:VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState
determines whether the final color values latexmath:[$R, G, B$] and
latexmath:[$A$] are written to the framebuffer attachment.
pname:colorWriteMask is any combination of the following bits:

Description
-----------

If ename:VK_COLOR_COMPONENT_R_BIT is set, then the latexmath:[$R$] value is
written to color attachment for the appropriate sample, otherwise the value
in memory is unmodified. The ename:VK_COLOR_COMPONENT_G_BIT,
ename:VK_COLOR_COMPONENT_B_BIT, and ename:VK_COLOR_COMPONENT_A_BIT bits
similarly control writing of the latexmath:[$G, B,$] and latexmath:[$A$]
values. The pname:colorWriteMask is applied regardless of whether blending
is enabled.
