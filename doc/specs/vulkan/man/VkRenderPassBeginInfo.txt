VkRenderPassBeginInfo(3)
========================

Name
----
VkRenderPassBeginInfo - Structure specifying render pass begin info

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkRenderPassBeginInfo - Structure specifying render pass begin info

The sname:VkRenderPassBeginInfo structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkRenderPassBeginInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:renderPass is the render pass to begin an instance of.
  * pname:framebuffer is the framebuffer containing the attachments that are
    used with the render pass.
  * pname:renderArea is the render area that is affected by the render pass
    instance, and is described in more detail below.
  * pname:clearValueCount is the number of elements in pname:pClearValues.
  * pname:pClearValues is an array of slink:VkClearValue structures that
    contains clear values for each attachment, if the attachment uses a
    pname:loadOp value of ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR. The array is
    indexed by attachment number. Only elements corresponding to cleared
    attachments are used. Other elements of pname:pClearValues are ignored.


Description
-----------

pname:renderArea is the render area that is affected by the render pass
instance. The effects of attachment load, store and resolve operations are
restricted to the pixels whose x and y coordinates fall within the render
area on all attachments. The render area extends to all layers of
pname:framebuffer. The application must: ensure (using scissor if necessary)
that all rendering is contained within the render area, otherwise the pixels
outside of the render area become undefined and shader side effects may:
occur for fragments outside the render area. The render area must: be
contained within the framebuffer dimensions.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
There may: be a performance cost for using a render area smaller than the
framebuffer, unless it matches the render area granularity for the render
pass.
