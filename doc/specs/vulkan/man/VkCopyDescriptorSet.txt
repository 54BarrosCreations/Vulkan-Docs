VkCopyDescriptorSet(3)
======================

Name
----
VkCopyDescriptorSet - Structure specifying a copy descriptor set operation

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkCopyDescriptorSet - Structure specifying a copy descriptor set operation

The sname:VkCopyDescriptorSet structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkCopyDescriptorSet.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:srcSet, pname:srcBinding, and pname:srcArrayElement are the
    source set, binding, and array element, respectively.
  * pname:dstSet, pname:dstBinding, and pname:dstArrayElement are the
    destination set, binding, and array element, respectively.
  * pname:descriptorCount is the number of descriptors to copy from
    the source to destination. If pname:descriptorCount is greater than the
    number of remaining array elements in the source or destination binding,
    those affect consecutive bindings in a manner similar to
    slink:VkWriteDescriptorSet above.
