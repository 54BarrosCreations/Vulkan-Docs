===================

Name
----
VkPipelineLayout - Opaque handle to a pipeline layout object

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkPipelineLayout - Opaque handle to a pipeline layout object

Access to descriptor sets from a pipeline is accomplished through a
_pipeline layout_. Zero or more descriptor set layouts and zero or more push
constant ranges are combined to form a
pipeline layout object which describes the complete set of resources that
can: be accessed by a pipeline. The pipeline layout represents a sequence of
descriptor sets with each having a specific layout. This sequence of layouts
is used to determine the interface between shader stages and shader
resources. Each pipeline is created using a pipeline layout.

Pipeline layout objects are represented by sname:VkPipelineLayout handles:
