The sname:VkApplicationInfo structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkApplicationInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:pApplicationName is a pointer to a null-terminated UTF-8 string
    containing the name of the application.
  * pname:applicationVersion is an unsigned integer variable containing the
    developer-supplied version number of the application.
  * pname:pEngineName is a pointer to a null-terminated UTF-8 string
    containing the name of the engine (if any) used to create the
    application.
  * pname:engineVersion is an unsigned integer variable containing the
    developer-supplied version number of the engine used to create the
    application.
  * pname:apiVersion is the version of the Vulkan API against which the
    application expects to run, encoded as described in the
    <<fundamentals-versionnum,API Version Numbers and Semantics>> section.
    If pname:apiVersion is 0 the implementation must: ignore it, otherwise
    if the implementation does not support the requested pname:apiVersion it
    must: return ename:VK_ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_DRIVER. The patch version number
    specified in pname:apiVersion is ignored when creating an instance
    object. Only the major and minor versions of the instance must: match
    those requested in pname:apiVersion.
