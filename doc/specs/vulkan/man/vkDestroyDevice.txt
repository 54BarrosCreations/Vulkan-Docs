vkDestroyDevice(3)
==================

Name
----
vkDestroyDevice - Destroy a logical device.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkDestroyDevice Destroy a logical device.

To destroy a device, call:

include::../protos/vkDestroyDevice.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:device is the logical device to destroy.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.


Description
-----------

To ensure that no work is active on the device, flink:vkDeviceWaitIdle
can: be used to gate the destruction of the device. Prior to destroying a
device, an application is responsible for destroying/freeing any Vulkan
objects that were created using that device as the first parameter of the
corresponding ftext:vkCreate* or ftext:vkAllocate* command.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The lifetime of each of these objects is bound by the lifetime of the
sname:VkDevice object. Therefore, to avoid resource leaks, it is critical
that an application explicitly free all of these resources prior to calling
fname:vkDestroyDevice.
