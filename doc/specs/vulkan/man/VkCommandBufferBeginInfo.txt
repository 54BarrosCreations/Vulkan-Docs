VkCommandBufferBeginInfo(3)
===========================

Name
----
VkCommandBufferBeginInfo - Structure specifying a command buffer begin operation

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkCommandBufferBeginInfo - Structure specifying a command buffer begin operation

The sname:VkCommandBufferBeginInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkCommandBufferBeginInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is a bitmask indicating usage behavior for the command
    buffer. Bits which can: be set include:
+
--
// refBegin VkCommandBufferUsageFlagBits - Bitmask specifying usage behavior for command buffer
include::../api/enums/VkCommandBufferUsageFlagBits.txt[]
--
+
  ** ename:VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_ONE_TIME_SUBMIT_BIT indicates that each
     recording of the command buffer will only be submitted once, and the
     command buffer will be reset and recorded again between each submission.
  ** ename:VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_RENDER_PASS_CONTINUE_BIT indicates that
     a secondary command buffer is considered to be entirely inside a render
     pass. If this is a primary command buffer, then this bit is ignored.
  ** Setting ename:VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_SIMULTANEOUS_USE_BIT allows the
     command buffer to be resubmitted to a queue or recorded into a primary
     command buffer while it is pending execution.
  * pname:pInheritanceInfo is a pointer to a
    sname:VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo structure, which is used if
    pname:commandBuffer is a secondary command buffer. If this is a primary
    command buffer, then this value is ignored.
