VkMemoryType(3)

Name
----
VkMemoryType - Structure specifying memory type

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkMemoryType - Structure specifying memory type

The sname:VkMemoryType structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkMemoryType.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:heapIndex describes which memory heap this memory type
    corresponds to, and must: be less than pname:memoryHeapCount from the
    sname:VkPhysicalDeviceMemoryProperties structure.
  * pname:propertyFlags is a bitmask of properties for this memory type. The
    bits specified in pname:propertyFlags are:
+
--
// refBegin VkMemoryPropertyFlagBits - Bitmask specifying properties for a memory type
include::../enums/VkMemoryPropertyFlagBits.txt[]
--
  ** if pname:propertyFlags has the
     ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT bit set, memory allocated
     with this type is the most efficient for device access. This property
     will only be set for memory types belonging to heaps with the
     ename:VK_MEMORY_HEAP_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT set.
  ** if pname:propertyFlags has the
     ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT bit set, memory allocated
     with this type can: be mapped using flink:vkMapMemory so that it can:
     be accessed on the host.
  ** if pname:propertyFlags has the
     ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT bit set, host cache
     management commands fname:vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges and
     fname:vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges are not needed to make host writes
     visible to the device or device writes visible to the host,
     respectively.
  ** if pname:propertyFlags has the
     ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_CACHED_BIT bit set, memory allocated
     with this type is cached on the host. Host memory accesses to
     uncached memory are slower than to cached memory, however uncached
     memory is always host coherent.
  ** if pname:propertyFlags has the
     ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_LAZILY_ALLOCATED_BIT bit set, the memory type
     only allows device access to the memory. Memory types must: not have
     both ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_LAZILY_ALLOCATED_BIT and
     ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT set. Additionally,
     the object's backing memory may: be provided by the implementation
     lazily as specified in <<memory-device-lazy_allocation, Lazily
     Allocated Memory>>.
