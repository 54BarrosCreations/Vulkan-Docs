VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo(3)
=================================

Name
----
VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo - Structure specifying command buffer inheritance info

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo - Structure specifying command buffer inheritance info

If the command buffer is a secondary command buffer, then the
sname:VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo structure defines any state that will
be inherited from the primary command buffer:

include::../structs/VkCommandBufferInheritanceInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:renderPass is a sname:VkRenderPass object that must: be
    <<renderpass-compatibility, compatible>> with the one that is bound when
    the sname:VkCommandBuffer is executed if the command buffer was
    allocated with the
    ename:VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_RENDER_PASS_CONTINUE_BIT set.
  * pname:subpass is the index of the subpass within pname:renderPass that
    the sname:VkCommandBuffer will be rendering against if it was allocated
    with the ename:VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_RENDER_PASS_CONTINUE_BIT set.
  * pname:framebuffer refers to the sname:VkFramebuffer object that the
    sname:VkCommandBuffer will be rendering to if it was allocated with
    the ename:VK_COMMAND_BUFFER_USAGE_RENDER_PASS_CONTINUE_BIT set. It can:
    be dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE if the framebuffer is not known.
+
[NOTE]
.Note
====
Specifying the exact framebuffer that the secondary command buffer will be
executed with may: result in better performance at command buffer execution
time.
====
  * pname:occlusionQueryEnable indicates whether the command buffer can: be
    executed while an occlusion query is active in the primary command
    buffer. If this is ename:VK_TRUE, then this command buffer can: be
    executed whether the primary command buffer has an occlusion query
    active or not. If this is ename:VK_FALSE, then the primary command
    buffer mustnot: have an occlusion query active.
  * pname:queryFlags indicates the query flags that can: be used by an
    active occlusion query in the primary command buffer when this secondary
    command buffer is executed. If this value includes the
    ename:VK_QUERY_CONTROL_PRECISE_BIT bit, then the active query can:
    return boolean results or actual sample counts. If this bit is not set,
    then the active query mustnot: use the
    ename:VK_QUERY_CONTROL_PRECISE_BIT bit. If this is a primary command
    buffer, then this value is ignored.
  * pname:pipelineStatistics indicates the set of pipeline statistics that
    can: be counted by an active query in the primary command buffer when
    this secondary command buffer is executed. If this value includes a
    given bit, then this command buffer can: be executed whether the primary
    command buffer has a pipeline statistics query active that includes this
    bit or not. If this value excludes a given bit, then the active pipeline
    statistics query mustnot: be from a query pool that counts that
    statistic.
