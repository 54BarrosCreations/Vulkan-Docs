// refBegin VkQueryPipelineStatisticFlagBits - Bitmask specifying queried pipeline statistics

Bits which can: be set in pname:pipelineStatistics include:

include::../enums/VkQueryPipelineStatisticFlagBits.txt[]


Description
-----------

These bits have the following meanings:

  * If ename:VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_INPUT_ASSEMBLY_VERTICES_BIT is set,
    queries managed by the pool will count the number of vertices processed
    by the <<drawing,input assembly>> stage. Vertices corresponding to
    incomplete primitives may: contribute to the count.
  * If ename:VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_INPUT_ASSEMBLY_PRIMITIVES_BIT is
    set, queries managed by the pool will count the number of primitives
    processed by the <<drawing,input assembly>> stage. If primitive restart
    is enabled, restarting the primitive topology has no effect on the
    count. Incomplete primitives may: be counted.
  * If ename:VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_VERTEX_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT is
    set, queries managed by the pool will count the number of vertex shader
    invocations. This counter's value is incremented each time a vertex
    shader is <<shaders-vertex-execution,invoked>>.
  * If ename:VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_GEOMETRY_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT is
    set, queries managed by the pool will count the number of geometry
    shader invocations. This counter's value is incremented each time a
    geometry shader is <<shaders-geometry-execution,invoked>>. In the case
    of <<geometry-invocations,instanced geometry shaders>>, the geometry
    shader invocations count is incremented for each separate instanced
    invocation.
  * If ename:VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_GEOMETRY_SHADER_PRIMITIVES_BIT is
    set, queries managed by the pool will count the number of primitives
    generated by geometry shader invocations. The counter's value is
    incremented each time the geometry shader emits a primitive. Restarting
    primitive topology using the SPIR-V instructions code:OpEndPrimitive or
    code:OpEndStreamPrimitive has no effect on the geometry shader output
    primitives count.
  * If ename:VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_CLIPPING_INVOCATIONS_BIT is set,
    queries managed by the pool will count the number of primitives
    processed by the <<vertexpostproc-clipping,Primitive Clipping>> stage of
    the pipeline. The counter's value is incremented each time a primitive
    reaches the primitive clipping stage.
  * If ename:VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_CLIPPING_PRIMITIVES_BIT is set,
    queries managed by the pool will count the number of primitives output
    by the <<vertexpostproc-clipping,Primitive Clipping>> stage of the
    pipeline. The counter's value is incremented each time a primitive
    passes the primitive clipping stage. The actual number of primitives
    output by the primitive clipping stage for a particular input primitive
    is implementation-dependent but must: satisfy the following conditions:
  ** If at least one vertex of the input primitive lies inside the clipping
     volume, the counter is incremented by one or more.
  ** Otherwise, the counter is incremented by zero or more.
  * If ename:VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_FRAGMENT_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT is
    set, queries managed by the pool will count the number of fragment
    shader invocations. The counter's value is incremented each time the
    fragment shader is <<shaders-fragment-execution,invoked>>.
  * If
    ename:VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_TESSELLATION_CONTROL_SHADER_PATCHES_BIT
    is set, queries managed by the pool will count the number of patches
    processed by the tessellation control shader. The counter's value is
    incremented once for each patch for which a tessellation control shader
    is <<shaders-tessellation-control-execution,invoked>>.
  * If
    ename:VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_TESSELLATION_EVALUATION_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT
    is set, queries managed by the pool will count the number of invocations
    of the tessellation evaluation shader. The counter's value is
    incremented each time the tessellation evaluation shader is
    <<shaders-tessellation-evaluation-execution,invoked>>.
  * If ename:VK_QUERY_PIPELINE_STATISTIC_COMPUTE_SHADER_INVOCATIONS_BIT is
    set, queries managed by the pool will count the number of compute shader
    invocations. The counter's value is incremented every time the compute
    shader is invoked. Implementations may: skip the execution of certain
    compute shader invocations or execute additional compute shader
    invocations for implementation-dependent reasons as long as the results
    of rendering otherwise remain unchanged.

These values are intended to measure relative statistics on one
implementation. Various device architectures will count these values
differently. Any or all counters may: be affected by the issues described in
<<queries-operation-undefined,Query Operation>>.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
For example, tile-based rendering devices may: need to replay the scene
multiple times, affecting some of the counts.
====

If a pipeline has pname:rasterizerDiscardEnable enabled, implementations
may: discard primitives after the final vertex processing stage. As a
result, if pname:rasterizerDiscardEnable is enabled, the clipping input and
output primitives counters may: not be incremented.

When a pipeline statistics query finishes, the result for that query is
marked as available. The application can: copy the result to a
buffer (via fname:vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults), or request it be put into host
memory (via fname:vkGetQueryPoolResults).
