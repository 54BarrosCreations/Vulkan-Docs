C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCreateXlibSurfaceKHR - Create a slink:VkSurfaceKHR object for an X11 window, using the Xlib client-side library

Parameters
----------

  * pname:instance is the instance to associate the surface with.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    sname:VkXlibSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure containing the parameters
    affecting the creation of the surface object.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).
