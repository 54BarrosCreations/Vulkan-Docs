VkClearColorValue(3)
====================

Name
----
VkClearColorValue - Structure specifying a clear color value

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkClearColorValue - Structure specifying a clear color value

The sname:VkClearColorValue structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkClearColorValue.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:float32 are the color clear values when the format of the image or
    attachment is floating point, unorm, snorm, uscaled, packed float, or
    sRGB. Floating point values are automatically converted to the format of
    the image, with the clear value being treated as linear if the image is
    sRGB.
  * pname:int32 are the color clear values when the format of the image or
    attachment is signed integer. Signed integer values are converted to the
    format of the image by casting to the smaller type (with negative 32-bit
    values mapping to negative values in the smaller type). If the integer
    clear value is not representable in the target type (e.g. would overflow
    in conversion to that type), the clear value is undefined.
  * pname:uint32 are the color clear values when the format of the image or
    attachment is unsigned integer. Unsigned integer values are converted to
    the format of the image by casting to the integer type with fewer bits.


Description
-----------

The four array elements of the clear color map to R, G, B, and A components
of image formats, in order.

If the image has more than one sample, the same value is written to all
samples for any pixels being cleared.
