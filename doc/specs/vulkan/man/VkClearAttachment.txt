VkClearAttachment(3)
====================

Name
----
VkClearAttachment - Structure specifying a clear attachment

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkClearAttachment - Structure specifying a clear attachment

The sname:VkClearAttachment structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkClearAttachment.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:aspectMask is a mask selecting the color, depth and/or stencil
    aspects of the attachment to be cleared. pname:aspectMask can: include
    ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT for color attachments,
    ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_DEPTH_BIT for depth/stencil attachments with a
    depth component, and ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_STENCIL_BIT for depth/stencil
    attachments with a stencil component. If the subpass's depth/stencil
    attachment is ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED, then the clear has no effect.
  * pname:colorAttachment is only meaningful if
    ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_COLOR_BIT is set in pname:aspectMask, in which
    case it is an index to the pname:pColorAttachments array in the
    slink:VkSubpassDescription structure of the current subpass which
    selects the color attachment to clear. If pname:colorAttachment is
    ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED or is greater than or equal to
    sname:VkSubpassDescription::pname:colorAttachmentCount, then the clear has
    no effect.
  * pname:clearValue is the color or depth/stencil value to clear the
    attachment to, as described in <<clears-values,Clear Values>> below.


Description
-----------

No memory barriers are needed between fname:vkCmdClearAttachments and
preceding or subsequent draw or attachment clear commands in the same
subpass.

The fname:vkCmdClearAttachments command is not affected by the bound
pipeline state.

Attachments can: also be cleared at the beginning of a render pass instance
by setting pname:loadOp (or pname:stencilLoadOp) of
slink:VkAttachmentDescription to ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR, as
described for flink:vkCreateRenderPass.
