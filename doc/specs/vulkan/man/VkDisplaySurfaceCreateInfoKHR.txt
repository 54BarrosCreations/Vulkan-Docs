VkDisplaySurfaceCreateInfoKHR(3)
================================

Name
----
VkDisplaySurfaceCreateInfoKHR - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created display plane surface object

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkDisplaySurfaceCreateInfoKHR - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created display plane surface object

The sname:VkDisplaySurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkDisplaySurfaceCreateInfoKHR.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure and must: be
    ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DISPLAY_SURFACE_CREATE_INFO_KHR.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use, and must: be zero.
  * pname:displayMode is the mode to use when displaying this surface.
  * pname:planeIndex is the plane on which this surface appears.
  * pname:planeStackIndex is the z-order of the plane.
  * pname:transform is the transform to apply to the images as part of the
    scannout operation.
  * pname:globalAlpha is the global alpha value.  This value is ignored if
    pname:alphaMode is not ename:VK_DISPLAY_PLANE_ALPHA_GLOBAL_BIT_KHR.
  * pname:alphaMode is the type of alpha blending to use.
  * pname:imageSize The size of the presentable images to use with the
    surface.


Description
-----------

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Creating a display surface mustnot: modify the state of the displays,
planes, or other resources it names.  For example, it mustnot: apply the
specified mode to be set on the associated display.  Application of
display configuration occurs as a side effect of presenting to a
display surface.
