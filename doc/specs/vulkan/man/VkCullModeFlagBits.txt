VkCullModeFlagBits(3)
=====================

Name
----
VkCullModeFlagBits - Bitmask controlling triangle culling

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkCullModeFlagBits - Bitmask controlling triangle culling

Once the orientation of triangles is determined, they are culled according
to the setting of the
slink:VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo::pname:cullMode property of the
currently active pipeline, which takes the following values:

include::../api/enums/VkCullModeFlagBits.txt[]


Description
-----------

If the pname:cullMode is set to ename:VK_CULL_MODE_NONE no triangles are
discarded, if it is set to ename:VK_CULL_MODE_FRONT_BIT front-facing
triangles are discarded, if it is set to ename:VK_CULL_MODE_BACK_BIT then
back-facing triangles are discarded and if it is set to
ename:VK_CULL_MODE_FRONT_AND_BACK then all triangles are discarded.
Following culling, fragments are produced for any triangles which have not
been discarded.
