vkCmdEndQuery(3)
================

Name
----
vkCmdEndQuery - Ends a query.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCmdEndQuery Ends a query.

To end a query after the set of desired draw or dispatch commands is
executed, call:

include::../protos/vkCmdEndQuery.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which this command will
    be recorded.
  * pname:queryPool is the query pool that is managing the results of the
    query.
  * pname:query is the query index within the query pool where the result is
    stored.


Description
-----------

[[queries-operation-finished]]
As queries operate asynchronously, ending a query does not immediately set
the query's status to available. A query is considered _finished_
when the final results of the query are ready to be retrieved by
flink:vkGetQueryPoolResults and flink:vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults, and this
is when the query's status is set to available.

Once a query is ended the query must: finish in finite time, unless the
state of the query is changed using other commands, e.g. by issuing a reset
of the query.
