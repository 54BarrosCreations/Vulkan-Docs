vkCmdSetScissor(3)
==================

Name
----
vkCmdSetScissor - Set the dynamic scissor rectangles on a command buffer.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCmdSetScissor Set the dynamic scissor rectangles on a command buffer.

The scissor test determines if a fragment's framebuffer coordinates
latexmath:[$(x_f,y_f)$] lie within the scissor rectangle corresponding to
the viewport index (see <<vertexpostproc-viewport,Controlling the
Viewport>>) used by the primitive that generated the fragment. If the
pipeline state object is created without ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_SCISSOR
enabled then the scissor rectangles are set by the
slink:VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo state of the pipeline state object.
Otherwise, to dynamically set the scissor rectangles call:

Parameters
----------

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be
    recorded.
  * pname:firstScissor is the index of the first scissor whose state is
    updated by the command.
  * pname:scissorCount is the number of scissors whose rectangles are
    updated by the command.
  * pname:pScissors is a pointer to an array of slink:VkRect2D structures
    defining scissor rectangles.


Description
-----------

The scissor rectangles taken from element latexmath:[$i$] of pname:pScissors
replace the current state for the scissor index
latexmath:[$\mathit{firstScissor}+i$], for latexmath:[$i$] in
latexmath:[$[0, scissorCount)$].

Each scissor rectangle is described by a slink:VkRect2D structure, with the
pname:offset.x and pname:offset.y values determining the upper left corner
of the scissor rectangle, and the pname:extent.width and pname:extent.height
values determining the size in pixels.
