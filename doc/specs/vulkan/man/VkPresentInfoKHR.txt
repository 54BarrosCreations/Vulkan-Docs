VkPresentInfoKHR(3)
===================

Name
----
VkPresentInfoKHR - Structure describing parameters of a queue presentation

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkPresentInfoKHR - Structure describing parameters of a queue presentation

The sname:VkPresentInfoKHR structure is defined as:

include::../../api/structs/VkPresentInfoKHR.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure and must: be
    ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PRESENT_INFO_KHR.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:waitSemaphoreCount is the number of semaphores to wait for before
    issuing the present request.  The number may: be zero.
  * pname:pWaitSemaphores, if not code:VK_NULL_HANDLE, is an array of
    sname:VkSemaphore
    objects with pname:waitSemaphoreCount entries, and specifies the
    semaphores to wait for before issuing the present request.
  * pname:swapchainCount is the number of swapchains being presented to
    by this command.
  * pname:pSwapchains is an array of sname:VkSwapchainKHR objects with
    pname:swapchainCount entries.  A given swapchain mustnot: appear in this
    list more than once.
  * pname:pImageIndices is an array of indices into the array of each
    swapchain's presentable images, with pname:swapchainCount entries.  Each
    entry in this array identifies the image to present on the corresponding
    entry in the pname:pSwapchains array.
  * pname:pResults is an array of ename:VkResult typed elements with
    pname:swapchainCount entries. Applications that don't need per-swapchain
    results can: use `NULL` for pname:pResults. If non-`NULL`, each entry in
    pname:pResults will be set to the ename:VkResult for presenting the
    swapchain corresponding to the same index in pname:pSwapchains.
