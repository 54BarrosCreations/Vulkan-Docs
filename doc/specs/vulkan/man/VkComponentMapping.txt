VkComponentMapping(3)
=====================

Name
----
VkComponentMapping - Structure specifying a color component mapping

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkComponentMapping - Structure specifying a color component mapping

The sname:VkComponentMapping structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkComponentMapping.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:r determines the component value placed in the R component of the
    output vector.
  * pname:g determines the component value placed in the G component of the
    output vector.
  * pname:b determines the component value placed in the B component of the
    output vector.
  * pname:a determines the component value placed in the A component of the
    output vector.


Description
-----------

Each of pname:r, pname:g, pname:b, and pname:a is one of the values:

// refBegin VkComponentSwizzle - specify how a component is swizzled
include::../api/enums/VkComponentSwizzle.txt[]

  * ename:VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_IDENTITY: the component is set to the
    identity swizzle.
  * ename:VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_ZERO: the component is set to zero.
  * ename:VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_ONE: the component is set to either 1 or 1.0
    depending on whether the type of the image view format is integer or
    floating-point respectively, as determined by the
    <<features-formats-definition,Format Definition>> section for each
    elink:VkFormat.
  * ename:VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_R: the component is set to the value
    of the R component of the image.
  * ename:VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_G: the component is set to the value
    of the G component of the image.
  * ename:VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_B: the component is set to the value
    of the B component of the image.
  * ename:VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_A: the component is set to the value
    of the A component of the image.

Setting the identity swizzle on a component is equivalent to setting the
identity mapping on that component. That is:

[[resources-image-views-identity-mappings]]
.Component Mappings Equivalent To ename:VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_IDENTITY
[options="header"]
|====
| Component          | Identity Mapping
| pname:components.r | ename:VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_R
| pname:components.g | ename:VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_G
| pname:components.b | ename:VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_B
| pname:components.a | ename:VK_COMPONENT_SWIZZLE_A
