vkCmdBindDescriptorSets(3)
==========================

Name
----
vkCmdBindDescriptorSets - Binds descriptor sets to a command buffer.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCmdBindDescriptorSets Binds descriptor sets to a command buffer.

To bind one or more descriptor sets to a command buffer, call:

include::../protos/vkCmdBindDescriptorSets.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer that the descriptor sets will
    be bound to.
  * pname:pipelineBindPoint is a elink:VkPipelineBindPoint indicating
    whether the descriptors will be used by graphics pipelines or compute
    pipelines. There is a separate set of bind points for each of graphics
    and compute, so binding one does not disturb the other.
  * pname:layout is a sname:VkPipelineLayout object used to program the
    bindings.
  * pname:firstSet is the set number of the first descriptor set to be
    bound.
  * pname:descriptorSetCount is the number of elements in the
    pname:pDescriptorSets array.
  * pname:pDescriptorSets is an array of handles to sname:VkDescriptorSet
    objects describing the descriptor sets to write to.
  * pname:dynamicOffsetCount is the number of dynamic offsets
    in the pname:pDynamicOffsets array.
  * pname:pDynamicOffsets is a pointer to an array of basetype:uint32_t
    values specifying dynamic offsets.


Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdBindDescriptorSets causes the sets numbered [pname:firstSet..
pname:firstSet+pname:descriptorSetCount-1] to use the bindings stored in
pname:pDescriptorSets[0..pname:descriptorSetCount-1] for subsequent
rendering commands (either compute or graphics, according to the
pname:pipelineBindPoint). Any bindings that were previously applied via
these sets are no longer valid.

Once bound, a descriptor set affects rendering of subsequent graphics or
compute commands in the command buffer until a different set is bound to the
same set number, or else until the set is disturbed as described in
<<descriptorsets-compatibility, Pipeline Layout Compatibility>>.

A compatible descriptor set must: be bound for all set numbers that any
shaders in a pipeline access, at the time that a draw or dispatch command is
recorded to execute using that pipeline. However, if none of the shaders in
a pipeline statically use any bindings with a particular set number, then no
descriptor set need be bound for that set number, even if the pipeline
layout includes a non-trivial descriptor set layout for that set number.

If any of the sets being bound include dynamic uniform or storage buffers,
then pname:pDynamicOffsets includes one element for each array element
in each dynamic descriptor type binding in each set. Values are taken from
pname:pDynamicOffsets in an order such that all entries for set N come
before set N+1; within a set, entries are ordered by the binding numbers in
the descriptor set layouts; and within a binding array, elements are in
order. pname:dynamicOffsetCount must: equal the total number of dynamic
descriptors in the sets being bound.

The effective offset used for dynamic uniform and storage buffer bindings is
the sum of the relative offset taken from pname:pDynamicOffsets, and the
base address of the buffer plus base offset in the descriptor set. The
length of the dynamic uniform and storage buffer bindings is the buffer
range as specified in the descriptor set.

Each of the pname:pDescriptorSets must: be compatible with the pipeline
layout specified by pname:layout. The layout used to program the bindings
must: also be compatible with the pipeline used in subsequent graphics or
compute commands, as defined in the <<descriptorsets-compatibility, Pipeline
Layout Compatibility>> section.

The descriptor set contents bound by a call to fname:vkCmdBindDescriptorSets
may: be consumed during host execution of the command, or during
shader execution of the resulting draws, or any time in between. Thus, the
contents mustnot: be altered (overwritten by an update command, or freed)
between when the command is recorded and when the command completes
executing on the queue. The contents of pname:pDynamicOffsets are consumed
immediately during execution of fname:vkCmdBindDescriptorSets. Once all
pending uses have completed, it is legal to update and reuse a descriptor
set.
