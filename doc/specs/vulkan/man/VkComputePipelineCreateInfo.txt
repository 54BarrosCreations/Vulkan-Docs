VkComputePipelineCreateInfo(3)
==============================

Name
----
VkComputePipelineCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created compute pipeline

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkComputePipelineCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created compute pipeline

The sname:VkComputePipelineCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkComputePipelineCreateInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags provides options for pipeline creation, and is of type
    elink:VkPipelineCreateFlagBits.
  * pname:stage is a slink:VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo describing the
    compute shader.
  * pname:layout is the description of binding locations used by both the
    pipeline and descriptor sets used with the pipeline.
  * pname:basePipelineHandle is a pipeline to derive from
  * pname:basePipelineIndex is an index into the pname:pCreateInfos
    parameter to use as a pipeline to derive from


Description
-----------

The parameters pname:basePipelineHandle and pname:basePipelineIndex are
described in more detail in
<<pipelines-pipeline-derivatives,Pipeline Derivatives>>.

pname:stage points to a structure of type
sname:VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo.
