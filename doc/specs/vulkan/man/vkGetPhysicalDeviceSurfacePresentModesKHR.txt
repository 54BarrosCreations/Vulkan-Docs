vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR(3)
============================================

Name
----
vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR - Query supported presentation modes

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR - Query supported presentation modes

To query the supported presentation modes for a surface, call:

include::../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device that will be associated with
    the swapchain to be created, as described for
    flink:vkCreateSwapchainKHR.
  * pname:surface is the surface that will be associated with the swapchain.
  * pname:pPresentModeCount is a pointer to an integer related to the
    number of presentation modes available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pPresentModes is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array
    of elink:VkPresentModeKHR structures.


Description
-----------

If pname:pPresentModes is `NULL`, then the number of presentation modes
supported for the given pname:surface is returned in
pname:pPresentModeCount. Otherwise, pname:pPresentModeCount must: point to a
variable set by the user to the number of elements in the
pname:pPresentModes array, and on return the variable is overwritten with
the number of values actually written to pname:pPresentModes. If the
value of pname:pPresentModeCount is less than the number of presentation
modes supported, at most pname:pPresentModeCount values will be written.
If pname:pPresentModeCount is smaller than the number of presentation modes
supported for the given pname:surface, ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned
instead of ename:VK_SUCCESS to indicate that not all the available values
were returned.
