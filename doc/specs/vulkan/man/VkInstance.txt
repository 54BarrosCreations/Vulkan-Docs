VkInstance(3)
=============

Name
----
VkInstance - Opaque handle to a instance object

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkInstance - Opaque handle to a instance object

There is no global state in Vulkan and all per-application state is
stored in a sname:VkInstance object. Creating a sname:VkInstance object
initializes the Vulkan library and allows the application to pass
information about itself to the implementation.

Instances are represented by sname:VkInstance handles:
