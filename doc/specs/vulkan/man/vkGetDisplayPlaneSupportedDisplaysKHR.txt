vkGetDisplayPlaneSupportedDisplaysKHR(3)
========================================

Name
----
vkGetDisplayPlaneSupportedDisplaysKHR - Query the list of displays a plane supports

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkGetDisplayPlaneSupportedDisplaysKHR - Query the list of displays a plane supports

To determine which displays a plane is usable with, call

include::../../api/protos/vkGetDisplayPlaneSupportedDisplaysKHR.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:physicalDevice is a physical device.
  * pname:planeIndex is the plane which the application wishes to use, and
    must: be in the range latexmath:[$[0, \mathit{physical device plane
    count}-1\]$].
  * pname:pDisplayCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number of
    display planes available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pDisplays is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    sname:VkDisplayKHR structures.


Description
-----------

If pname:pDisplays is `NULL`, then the number of displays usable with the
specified pname:planeIndex for pname:physicalDevice is returned in
pname:pDisplayCount. Otherwise, pname:pDisplayCount must: point to a
variable set by the user to the number of elements in the pname:pDisplays
array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of
structures actually written to pname:pDisplays. If the value of
pname:pDisplayCount is less than the number of display planes for
pname:physicalDevice, at most pname:pDisplayCount structures will be
written. If pname:pDisplayCount is smaller than the number of displays
usable with the specified pname:planeIndex for pname:physicalDevice,
ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead of ename:VK_SUCCESS to indicate
that not all the available values were returned.
