VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo(3)
=======================================

Name
----
VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created pipeline multisample state

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created pipeline multisample state

The sname:VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:rasterizationSamples is a elink:VkSampleCountFlagBits specifying
    the number of samples per pixel used in rasterization.
  * pname:sampleShadingEnable specifies that fragment shading executes
    per-sample if ename:VK_TRUE, or per-fragment if ename:VK_FALSE, as
    described in <<primsrast-sampleshading,Sample Shading>>.
  * pname:minSampleShading is the minimum fraction of sample shading, as
    described in <<primsrast-sampleshading,Sample Shading>>.
  * pname:pSampleMask is a bitmask of static coverage information that is
    ANDed with the coverage information generated during rasterization, as
    described in <<fragops-samplemask,Sample Mask>>.
  * pname:alphaToCoverageEnable controls whether a temporary coverage value
    is generated based on the alpha component of the fragment's
    first color output as specified in the <<fragops-covg,Multisample
    Coverage>> section.
  * pname:alphaToOneEnable controls whether the alpha component of the
    fragment's first color output is replaced with one as described in
    <<fragops-covg,Multisample Coverage>>.
