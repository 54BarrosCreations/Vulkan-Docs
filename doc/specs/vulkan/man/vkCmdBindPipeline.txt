vkCmdBindPipeline(3)
====================

Name
----
vkCmdBindPipeline - Bind a pipeline object to a command buffer.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCmdBindPipeline Bind a pipeline object to a command buffer.

Once a pipeline has been created, it can: be bound to the command buffer
using the command:

include::../protos/vkCmdBindPipeline.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer that the pipeline will be
    bound to.
  * pname:pipelineBindPoint specifies the bind point, and must: have one of
    the values
+
--
// refBegin VkPipelineBindPoint - specify the bind point of a pipeline object to a command buffer
include::../enums/VkPipelineBindPoint.txt[]
--
+
specifying whether pname:pipeline will be bound as a compute
(ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_COMPUTE) or graphics
(ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS) pipeline. There are separate bind
points for each of graphics and compute, so binding one does not disturb the
other.
+
  * pname:pipeline is the pipeline to be bound.


Description
-----------

Once bound, a pipeline binding affects subsequent graphics or compute
commands in the command buffer until a different pipeline is bound to the
bind point. The pipeline bound to ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_COMPUTE
controls the behavior of flink:vkCmdDispatch and
flink:vkCmdDispatchIndirect. The pipeline bound to
ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS controls the behavior of
flink:vkCmdDraw, flink:vkCmdDrawIndexed, flink:vkCmdDrawIndirect, and
flink:vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect. No other commands are affected by the
pipeline state.
