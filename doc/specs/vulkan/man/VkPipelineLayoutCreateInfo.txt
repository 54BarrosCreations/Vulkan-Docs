VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo(3)
=============================

Name
----
VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo - Structure specifying the parameters of a newly created pipeline layout object.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo Structure specifying the parameters of a newly created pipeline layout object.

The slink:VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:setLayoutCount is the number of descriptor sets included in
    the pipeline layout.
  * pname:pSetLayouts is a pointer to an array of
    sname:VkDescriptorSetLayout objects.
  * pname:pushConstantRangeCount is the number of push constant ranges
    included in the pipeline layout.
  * pname:pPushConstantRanges is a pointer to an array of
    sname:VkPushConstantRange structures defining a set of push constant
    ranges for use in a single pipeline layout. In addition to descriptor
    set layouts, a pipeline layout also describes how many push constants
    can: be accessed by each stage of the pipeline.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Push constants represent a high speed path to modify constant data in
pipelines that is expected to outperform memory-backed resource updates.
