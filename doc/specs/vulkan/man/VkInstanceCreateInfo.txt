The sname:VkInstanceCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkInstanceCreateInfo.txt[]


Members

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:pApplicationInfo is `NULL` or a pointer to an instance of
    sname:VkApplicationInfo. If not `NULL`, this information helps
    implementations recognize behavior inherent to classes of applications.
    slink:VkApplicationInfo is defined in detail below.
  * pname:enabledLayerCount is the number of global layers to enable.
  * pname:ppEnabledLayerNames is a pointer to an array of
    pname:enabledLayerCount null-terminated UTF-8 strings containing the
    names of layers to enable for the created instance. See the
    <<extended-functionality-layers,Layers>> section for further details.
  * pname:enabledExtensionCount is the number of global extensions to
    enable.
  * pname:ppEnabledExtensionNames is a pointer to an array of
    pname:enabledExtensionCount null-terminated UTF-8 strings containing the
