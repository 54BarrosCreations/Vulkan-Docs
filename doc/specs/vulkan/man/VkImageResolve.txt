The sname:VkImageResolve structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkImageResolve.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:srcSubresource and pname:dstSubresource are
    slink:VkImageSubresourceLayers structures specifying the image
    subresources of the images used for the source and destination image
    data, respectively. Resolve of depth/stencil images is not supported.
  * pname:srcOffset and pname:dstOffset select the initial x, y, and z
    offsets in texels of the sub-regions of the source and destination image
    data.
  * pname:extent is the size in texels of the source image to resolve in
    pname:width, pname:height and pname:depth. 1D images use only pname:x
    and pname:width. 2D images use pname:x, pname:y, pname:width and
    pname:height. 3D images use pname:x, pname:y, pname:z, pname:width,
    pname:height and pname:depth.
