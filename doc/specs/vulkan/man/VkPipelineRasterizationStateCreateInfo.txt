VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo(3)
=========================================

Name
----
VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created pipeline rasterization state

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created pipeline rasterization state

The sname:VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:depthClampEnable controls whether to clamp the fragment's depth
    values instead of clipping primitives to the z planes of the frustum, as
    described in <<vertexpostproc-clipping,Primitive Clipping>>.
  * pname:rasterizerDiscardEnable controls whether primitives are discarded
    immediately before the rasterization stage.
  * pname:polygonMode is the triangle rendering mode. See
    elink:VkPolygonMode.
  * pname:cullMode is the triangle facing direction used for primitive
    culling. See elink:VkCullModeFlagBits.
  * pname:frontFace is the front-facing triangle orientation to be used for
    culling. See elink:VkFrontFace.
  * pname:depthBiasEnable controls whether to bias fragment depth values.
  * pname:depthBiasConstantFactor is a scalar factor controlling the
    constant depth value added to each fragment.
  * pname:depthBiasClamp is the maximum (or minimum) depth bias of a
    fragment.
  * pname:depthBiasSlopeFactor is a scalar factor applied to a fragment's
    slope in depth bias calculations.
  * pname:lineWidth is the width of rasterized line segments.
