vkCreateDisplayPlaneSurfaceKHR(3)
=================================

Name
----
vkCreateDisplayPlaneSurfaceKHR - Create a slink:VkSurfaceKHR structure representing a display plane and mode

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCreateDisplayPlaneSurfaceKHR - Create a slink:VkSurfaceKHR structure representing a display plane and mode

To create a sname:VkSurfaceKHR structure representing a display plane and
mode, call

include::../../protos/vkCreateDisplayPlaneSurfaceKHR.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:instance is the instance corresponding to the physical device the
    targeted display is on.
  * pname:pCreateInfo:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkDisplaySurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure specifying which mode,
    plane, and other parameters to use, as described below.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    surface object when there is no more specific allocator available
    (see <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).
  * pname:pSurface points to a sname:VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the
    created surface is returned.
