VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR(3)
================================

Name
----
VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR - presentation transforms supported on a device

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR - presentation transforms supported on a device

The pname:supportedTransforms and pname:currentTransform members are of type
ename:VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR, which contains the following values:

include::../../enums/VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR.txt[]


Description
-----------

These values are described as follows:

  * ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_IDENTITY_BIT_KHR: The image content is
    presented without being transformed.
  * ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_ROTATE_90_BIT_KHR: The image content is
    rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
  * ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_ROTATE_180_BIT_KHR: The image content is
    rotated 180 degrees clockwise.
  * ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_ROTATE_270_BIT_KHR: The image content is
    rotated 270 degrees clockwise.
  * ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_HORIZONTAL_MIRROR_BIT_KHR: The image
    content is mirrored horizontally.
  * ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_HORIZONTAL_MIRROR_ROTATE_90_BIT_KHR: The
    image content is mirrored horizontally, then rotated 90 degrees
    clockwise.
  * ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_HORIZONTAL_MIRROR_ROTATE_180_BIT_KHR: The
    image content is mirrored horizontally, then rotated 180 degrees
    clockwise.
  * ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_HORIZONTAL_MIRROR_ROTATE_270_BIT_KHR: The
    image content is mirrored horizontally, then rotated 270 degrees
    clockwise.
  * ename:VK_SURFACE_TRANSFORM_INHERIT_BIT_KHR: The presentation transform
    is not specified, and is instead determined by platform-specific
    considerations and mechanisms outside Vulkan.
