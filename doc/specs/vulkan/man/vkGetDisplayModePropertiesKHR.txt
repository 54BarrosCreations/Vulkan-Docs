vkGetDisplayModePropertiesKHR(3)
================================

Name
----
vkGetDisplayModePropertiesKHR - Query the set of mode properties supported by the display

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkGetDisplayModePropertiesKHR - Query the set of mode properties supported by the display

Each display has one or more supported modes associated with it
by default.  These built-in modes are queried by calling:

include::../../api/protos/vkGetDisplayModePropertiesKHR.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device associated with
    pname:display.
  * pname:display is the display to query.
  * pname:pPropertyCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number of
    display modes available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pProperties is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    sname:VkDisplayModePropertiesKHR structures.


Description
-----------

If pname:pProperties is `NULL`, then the number of display modes available
on the specified pname:display for pname:physicalDevice is returned in
pname:pPropertyCount. Otherwise, pname:pPropertyCount must: point to a
variable set by the user to the number of elements in the pname:pProperties
array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of
structures actually written to pname:pProperties. If the value of
pname:pPropertyCount is less than the number of display modes for
pname:physicalDevice, at most pname:pPropertyCount structures will be
written. If pname:pPropertyCount is smaller than the number of display modes
available on the specified pname:display for pname:physicalDevice,
ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead of ename:VK_SUCCESS to indicate
that not all the available values were returned.
