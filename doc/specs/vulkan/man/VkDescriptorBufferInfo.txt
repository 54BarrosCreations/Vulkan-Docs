=========================

Name
----
VkDescriptorBufferInfo - Structure specifying descriptor buffer info

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkDescriptorBufferInfo - Structure specifying descriptor buffer info

The sname:VkDescriptorBufferInfo structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkDescriptorBufferInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:buffer is the buffer resource.
  * pname:offset is the offset in bytes from the start of pname:buffer.
    Access to buffer memory via this descriptor uses addressing that is
    relative to this starting offset.
  * pname:range is the size in bytes that is used for this descriptor
    update, or ename:VK_WHOLE_SIZE to use the range from pname:offset to the
    end of the buffer.


Description
-----------

For ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_DYNAMIC and
ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_BUFFER_DYNAMIC descriptor types,
pname:offset is the base offset from which the dynamic offset is applied and
pname:range is the static size used for all dynamic offsets.
