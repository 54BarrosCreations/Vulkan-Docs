C Specification

// refBegin VkSparseImageMemoryRequirements - Structure specifying sparse image memory requirements

The sname:VkSparseImageMemoryRequirements structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkSparseImageMemoryRequirements.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:formatProperties.aspectMask is the set of aspects of the image
    that this sparse memory requirement applies to. This will usually have a
    single aspect specified. However, depth/stencil images may: have depth
    and stencil data interleaved in the same sparse block, in which case
    both ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_DEPTH_BIT and
    ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_STENCIL_BIT would be present.
  * pname:formatProperties.imageGranularity describes the dimensions of a
    single bindable sparse image block in pixel units. For aspect
    ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_METADATA_BIT, all dimensions will be zero
    pixels. All metadata is located in the mip tail region.
  * pname:formatProperties.flags is a bitmask of
    elink:VkSparseImageFormatFlagBits:
  ** If ename:VK_SPARSE_IMAGE_FORMAT_SINGLE_MIPTAIL_BIT is set the image
     uses a single mip tail region for all array layers.
  ** If ename:VK_SPARSE_IMAGE_FORMAT_ALIGNED_MIP_SIZE_BIT is set the
     dimensions of mip levels must: be integer multiples of the corresponding
     dimensions of the sparse image block for levels not located in the mip
     tail.
  ** If ename:VK_SPARSE_IMAGE_FORMAT_NONSTANDARD_BLOCK_SIZE_BIT is set the
     image uses non-standard sparse image block dimensions. The
     pname:formatProperties.imageGranularity values do not match the
     standard sparse image block dimension corresponding to the image's
     pixel format.
  * pname:imageMipTailFirstLod is the first mip level at which image
    subresources are included in the mip tail region.
  * pname:imageMipTailSize is the memory size (in bytes) of the mip tail
    region. If pname:formatProperties.flags contains
    ename:VK_SPARSE_IMAGE_FORMAT_SINGLE_MIPTAIL_BIT, this is the size of the
    whole mip tail, otherwise this is the size of the mip tail of a single
    array layer. This value is guaranteed to be a multiple of the sparse block
    size in bytes.
  * pname:imageMipTailOffset is the opaque memory offset used with
    slink:VkSparseImageOpaqueMemoryBindInfo to bind the mip tail region(s).
  * pname:imageMipTailStride is the offset stride between each array-layer's
    mip tail, if pname:formatProperties.flags does not contain
    ename:VK_SPARSE_IMAGE_FORMAT_SINGLE_MIPTAIL_BIT (otherwise the value is
    undefined).
