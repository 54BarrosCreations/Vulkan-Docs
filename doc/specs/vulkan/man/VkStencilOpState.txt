===================

Name
----
VkStencilOpState - Structure specifying stencil operation state

C Specification

// refBegin VkStencilOpState - Structure specifying stencil operation state

The sname:VkStencilOpState structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkStencilOpState.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:failOp is the action performed on samples that fail the stencil
    test.
  * pname:passOp is the action performed on samples that pass both the depth
    and stencil tests.
  * pname:depthFailOp is the action performed on samples that pass the
    stencil test and fail the depth test.
  * pname:compareOp is the comparison operator used in the stencil test.
  * pname:compareMask selects the bits of the unsigned integer stencil

  * pname:writeMask selects the bits of the unsigned integer stencil values
    updated by the stencil test in the stencil framebuffer attachment.
  * pname:reference is an integer reference value that is used in the
    unsigned stencil comparison.
