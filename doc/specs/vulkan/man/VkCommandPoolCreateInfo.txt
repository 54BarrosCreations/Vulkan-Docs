VkCommandPoolCreateInfo(3)
==========================

Name
----
VkCommandPoolCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created command pool

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkCommandPoolCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created command pool

The sname:VkCommandPoolCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkCommandPoolCreateInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is a bitmask indicating usage behavior for the pool and
    command buffers allocated from it. Bits which can: be set include:
+
--
// refBegin VkCommandPoolCreateFlagBits - Bitmask specifying usage behavior for a command pool
include::../api/enums/VkCommandPoolCreateFlagBits.txt[]
--

  ** ename:VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_TRANSIENT_BIT indicates that command buffers
     allocated from the pool will be short-lived, meaning that they will be
     reset or freed in a relatively short timeframe. This flag may: be used by
     the implementation to control memory allocation behavior within the pool.
  ** ename:VK_COMMAND_POOL_CREATE_RESET_COMMAND_BUFFER_BIT controls whether
     command buffers allocated from the pool can: be individually reset. If
     this flag is set, individual command buffers allocated from the pool can:
     be reset either explicitly, by calling fname:vkResetCommandBuffer, or
     implicitly, by calling fname:vkBeginCommandBuffer on an executable
     command buffer. If this flag is not set, then fname:vkResetCommandBuffer
     and fname:vkBeginCommandBuffer (on an executable command buffer) mustnot:
     be called on the command buffers allocated from the pool, and they can:
     only be reset in bulk by calling fname:vkResetCommandPool.
  * pname:queueFamilyIndex designates a queue family as described in section
    <<devsandqueues-queueprops,Queue Family Properties>>. All command
    buffers created from this command pool must: be submitted on queues
    from the same queue family.
