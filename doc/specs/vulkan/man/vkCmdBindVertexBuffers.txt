vkCmdBindVertexBuffers(3)
=========================

Name
----
vkCmdBindVertexBuffers - Bind vertex buffers to a command buffer

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCmdBindVertexBuffers Bind vertex buffers to a command buffer

To bind vertex buffers to a command buffer for use in subsequent draw
commands, call:

include::../protos/vkCmdBindVertexBuffers.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command is
    recorded.
  * pname:firstBinding is the index of the first vertex input binding whose
    state is updated by the command.
  * pname:bindingCount is the number of vertex input bindings whose state is
    updated by the command.
  * pname:pBuffers is a pointer to an array of buffer handles.
  * pname:pOffsets is a pointer to an array of buffer offsets.


Description
-----------

The values taken from elements latexmath:[$i$] of pname:pBuffers and
pname:pOffsets replace the current state for the vertex input binding
latexmath:[$\mathit{firstBinding}+i$], for latexmath:[$i$] in
latexmath:[$[0, bindingCount)$]. The vertex input binding is updated to
start at the offset indicated by pname:pOffsets[i] from the start of the
buffer pname:pBuffers[i]. All vertex input attributes that use each of these
bindings will use these updated addresses in their address calculations for
subsequent draw commands.
