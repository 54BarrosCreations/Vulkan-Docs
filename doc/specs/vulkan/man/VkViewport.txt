VkViewport(3)
=============

Name
----
VkViewport - Structure specifying a viewport

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkViewport - Structure specifying a viewport

The sname:VkViewport structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkViewport.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:x and pname:y are the viewport's upper left corner
    latexmath:[$(x,y)$].
  * pname:width and pname:height are the viewport's width and height,
    respectively.
  * pname:minDepth and pname:maxDepth are the depth range for the viewport.
    It is valid for pname:minDepth to be greater than or equal to
    pname:maxDepth.


Description
-----------

The framebuffer depth coordinate latexmath:[$z_f$] may: be represented using
either a fixed-point or floating-point representation. However, a
floating-point representation must: be used if the depth/stencil attachment
has a floating-point depth component. If an latexmath:[$m$]-bit fixed-point
representation is used, we assume that it represents each value
latexmath:[$\frac{k}{2^m - 1}$], where latexmath:[$k \in \{ 0,1, \ldots,
2^m-1 \}$], as latexmath:[$k$] (e.g. 1.0 is represented in binary as a
string of all ones).

The viewport parameters shown in the above equations are found from these
values as

[latexmath]
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\begin{align*}
    o_x & = x + \frac{width}{2} \\
    o_y & = y + \frac{height}{2} \\
    o_z & = minDepth \\
    p_x & = width \\
    p_y & = height \\
    p_z & = maxDepth - minDepth.
\end{align*}
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The width and height of the <<features-limits-maxViewportDimensions,
implementation-dependent maximum viewport dimensions>> must: be greater
than or equal to the width and height of the largest image which can: be
created and attached to a framebuffer.

The floating-point viewport bounds are represented with an
<<features-limits-viewportSubPixelBits,implementation-dependent precision>>.
