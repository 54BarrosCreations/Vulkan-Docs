vkGetPhysicalDeviceSparseImageFormatProperties(3)
=================================================

Name
----
vkGetPhysicalDeviceSparseImageFormatProperties - Retrieve properties of an image format applied to sparse images.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkGetPhysicalDeviceSparseImageFormatProperties Retrieve properties of an image format applied to sparse images.

fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceSparseImageFormatProperties returns an
array of slink:VkSparseImageFormatProperties. Each element will describe
properties for one set of image aspects that are bound simultaneously in the
image. This is usually one element for each aspect in the image, but for
interleaved depth/stencil images there is only one element describing the
combined aspects.

Parameters
----------

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device from which to query the
    sparse image capabilities.
  * pname:format is the image format.
  * pname:type is the dimensionality of image.
  * pname:samples is the number of samples per pixel as defined in
    elink:VkSampleCountFlagBits.
  * pname:usage is a bitmask describing the intended usage of the image.
  * pname:tiling is the tiling arrangement of the data elements in memory.
  * pname:pPropertyCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number of
    sparse format properties available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pProperties is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkSparseImageFormatProperties structures.


Description
-----------

If pname:pProperties is `NULL`, then the number of sparse format properties
available is returned in pname:pPropertyCount. Otherwise,
pname:pPropertyCount must: point to a variable set by the user to the number
of elements in the pname:pProperties array, and on return the variable is
overwritten with the number of structures actually written to
pname:pProperties. If pname:pPropertyCount is less than the
number of sparse format properties available, at most pname:pPropertyCount
structures will be written.

If ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_RESIDENCY_BIT is not supported for the given
arguments, pname:pPropertyCount will be set to zero upon return, and no data
will be written to pname:pProperties.

Multiple aspects are returned for depth/stencil images that are implemented
as separate planes by the implementation. The depth and stencil data planes
each have unique sname:VkSparseImageFormatProperties data.

Depth/stencil images with depth and stencil data interleaved into a single
plane will return a single sname:VkSparseImageFormatProperties structure
with the pname:aspectMask set to ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_DEPTH_BIT |
ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_STENCIL_BIT.
