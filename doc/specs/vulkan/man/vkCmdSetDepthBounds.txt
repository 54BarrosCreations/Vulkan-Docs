vkCmdSetDepthBounds(3)
======================

Name
----
vkCmdSetDepthBounds - Set the depth bounds test values for a command buffer.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCmdSetDepthBounds Set the depth bounds test values for a command buffer.

The depth bounds test conditionally disables coverage of a sample based on
the outcome of a comparison between the value latexmath:[$z_a$] in the depth
attachment at location latexmath:[$(x_f,y_f)$] (for the appropriate sample)
and a range of values. The test is enabled or disabled by the
pname:depthBoundsTestEnable member of
slink:VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo: If the pipeline state object
is created without the ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_BOUNDS dynamic state
enabled then the range of values used in the depth bounds test are defined
by the pname:minDepthBounds and pname:maxDepthBounds members of the
slink:VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo structure. Otherwise, to
dynamically set the depth bounds range values call:

include::../api/protos/vkCmdSetDepthBounds.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be
    recorded.
  * pname:minDepthBounds is the lower bound of the range of depth values
    used in the depth bounds test.
  * pname:maxDepthBounds is the upper bound of the range.
