vkDestroySwapchainKHR(3)
========================

Name
----
vkDestroySwapchainKHR - Destroy a swapchain object

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkDestroySwapchainKHR - Destroy a swapchain object

To destroy a swapchain object call:

include::../api/protos/vkDestroySwapchainKHR.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:device is the sname:VkDevice assocated with pname:swapchain.
  * pname:swapchain is the swapchain to destroy.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    swapchain object when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).


Description
-----------

pname:swapchain and all associated sname:VkImage handles are destroyed, and
must: not be acquired or used any more by the application. The memory of
each sname:VkImage will only be freed after that image is no longer used by
the platform. For example, if one image of the swapchain is being displayed
in a window, the memory for that image may: not be freed until the window is
destroyed, or another swapchain is created for the window. Destroying the
swapchain does not invalidate the parent sname:VkSurfaceKHR, and a new
swapchain can: be created with it.
