VkFormatProperties(3)
=====================

Name
----
VkFormatProperties - Structure specifying image format properties

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkFormatProperties - Structure specifying image format properties

The sname:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkFormatProperties.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:linearTilingFeatures describes the features supported by
    ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR.
  * pname:optimalTilingFeatures describes the features supported by
    ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL.
  * pname:bufferFeatures describes the features supported by buffers.


Description
-----------

Supported features are described as a set of elink:VkFormatFeatureFlagBits:

// refBegin VkFormatFeatureFlagBits - Bitmask specifying features supported by a buffer
include::../enums/VkFormatFeatureFlagBits.txt[]

The pname:linearTilingFeatures and pname:optimalTilingFeatures members of
the sname:VkFormatProperties structure describe what features are supported
by ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR and ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL images,
respectively.

The following bits may: be set in pname:linearTilingFeatures and
pname:optimalTilingFeatures, indicating they are supported by images or
image views created with the queried
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties::pname:format:

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT::
    sname:VkImageView can: be sampled from. See
    <<descriptorsets-sampledimage, sampled images>> section.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_IMAGE_BIT::
    sname:VkImageView can: be used as storage image. See
    <<descriptorsets-storageimage, storage images>> section.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_IMAGE_ATOMIC_BIT::
    sname:VkImageView can: be used as storage image that supports atomic
    operations.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT::
    sname:VkImageView can: be used as a framebuffer color attachment and
    as an input attachment.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BLEND_BIT::
    sname:VkImageView can: be used as a framebuffer color attachment that
    supports blending and as an input attachment.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT::
    sname:VkImageView can: be used as a framebuffer depth/stencil attachment
    and as an input attachment.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_BLIT_SRC_BIT::
    sname:VkImage can: be used as pname:srcImage for the
    fname:vkCmdBlitImage command.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_BLIT_DST_BIT::
    sname:VkImage can: be used as pname:dstImage for the
    fname:vkCmdBlitImage command.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_FILTER_LINEAR_BIT::
    If ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT is also set,
    sname:VkImageView can: be used with a sampler that has either of
    pname:magFilter or pname:minFilter set to ename:VK_FILTER_LINEAR,
    or pname:mipmapMode set to ename:VK_SAMPLER_MIPMAP_MODE_LINEAR.
    If ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_BLIT_SRC_BIT is also set, sname:VkImage
    can be used as the pname:srcImage to flink:vkCmdBlitImage
    with a pname:filter of ename:VK_FILTER_LINEAR. This bit must: only be
    exposed for formats that also support the
    ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_BIT or
    ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_BLIT_SRC_BIT.
+
If the format being queried is a depth/stencil format, this bit only indicates
    that the depth aspect (not the stencil aspect) of an image of this format
    supports linear filtering,
    and that linear filtering of the depth aspect is supported whether depth
    compare is enabled in the sampler or not. If this bit is not present,
    linear filtering with depth compare disabled is unsupported and linear
    filtering with depth compare enabled is supported, but may: compute the
    filtered value in an implementation-dependent manner which differs from
    the normal rules of linear filtering. The resulting value must: be in the
    range latexmath:[$[0,1\]$] and should: be proportional to, or a weighted
    average of, the number of comparison passes or failures.

The following features may: appear in pname:bufferFeatures, indicating they
are supported by buffers or buffer views created with the queried
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties::pname:format:

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER_BIT::
    Format can: be used to create a sname:VkBufferView that can: be bound to
    a ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_TEXEL_BUFFER descriptor.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER_BIT::
    Format can: be used to create a sname:VkBufferView that can: be bound to
    a ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER descriptor.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER_ATOMIC_BIT::
    Atomic operations are supported on
    ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_TEXEL_BUFFER with this format.

ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_VERTEX_BUFFER_BIT::
    Format can: be used as a vertex attribute format
    (sname:VkVertexInputAttributeDescription.format).

If pname:format is a block-compression format, then buffers mustnot: support
any features for the format.
