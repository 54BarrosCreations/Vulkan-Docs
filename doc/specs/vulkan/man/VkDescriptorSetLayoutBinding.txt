VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding(3)
===============================

Name
----
VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding - Structure specifying a descriptor set layout binding

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding - Structure specifying a descriptor set layout binding

The sname:VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:binding is the binding number of this entry and corresponds
    to a resource of the same binding number in the shader stages.
  * pname:descriptorType is an elink:VkDescriptorType specifying which type
    of resource descriptors are used for this binding.
  * pname:descriptorCount is the number of descriptors contained in the
    binding, accessed in a shader as an array. If pname:descriptorCount is
    zero this binding entry is reserved and the resource mustnot: be
    accessed from any stage via this binding within any pipeline using the
    set layout.
  * pname:stageFlags member is a bitmask of elink:VkShaderStageFlagBits
    specifying which pipeline shader stages can: access a resource for this
    binding. ename:VK_SHADER_STAGE_ALL is a shorthand specifying that all
    defined shader stages, including any additional stages defined by
    extensions, can: access the resource.
+
--
If a shader stage is not included in pname:stageFlags, then a resource
mustnot: be accessed from that stage via this binding within any pipeline
using the set layout. There are no limitations on what combinations of
stages can: be used by a descriptor binding, and in particular a binding
can: be used by both graphics stages and the compute stage.
--
  * pname:pImmutableSamplers affects initialization of samplers. If
    pname:descriptorType specifies a ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLER or
    ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER type descriptor, then
    pname:pImmutableSamplers can: be used to initialize a set of _immutable
    samplers_. Immutable samplers are permanently bound into the set layout;
    later binding a sampler into an immutable sampler slot in a descriptor
    set is not allowed. If pname:pImmutableSamplers is not `NULL`, then it
    is considered to be a pointer to an array of sampler handles that will
    be consumed by the set layout and used for the corresponding binding. If
    pname:pImmutableSamplers is `NULL`, then the sampler slots are dynamic
    and sampler handles must: be bound into descriptor sets using this
    layout. If pname:descriptorType is not one of these descriptor types,
    then pname:pImmutableSamplers is ignored.


Description
-----------

The above layout definition allows the descriptor bindings to be specified
sparsely such that not all binding numbers between 0 and the maximum
binding number need to be specified in the pname:pBindings array. However,
all binding numbers between 0 and the maximum binding number may: consume
memory in the descriptor set layout even if not all descriptor bindings are
used, though it shouldnot:
consume additional memory from the descriptor pool.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
The maximum binding number specified should: be as compact as possible to
avoid wasted memory.
