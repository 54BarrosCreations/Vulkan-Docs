vkCmdDraw(3)
============

Name
----
vkCmdDraw - Draw primitives.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCmdDraw Draw primitives.

To record a non-indexed draw, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCmdDraw.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command is
    recorded.
  * pname:vertexCount is the number of vertices to draw.
  * pname:instanceCount is the number of instances to draw.
  * pname:firstVertex is the index of the first vertex to draw.
  * pname:firstInstance is the instance ID of the first instance to draw.


Description
-----------

When the command is executed, primitives are assembled using the current
primitive topology and pname:vertexCount consecutive vertex indices with the
first code:vertexIndex value equal to pname:firstVertex. The primitives are
drawn pname:instanceCount times with code:instanceIndex starting with
pname:firstInstance and increasing sequentially for each instance. The
assembled primitives execute the currently bound graphics pipeline.
