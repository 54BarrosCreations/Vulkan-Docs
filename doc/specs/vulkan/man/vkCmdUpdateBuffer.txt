vkCmdUpdateBuffer(3)
====================

Name
----
vkCmdUpdateBuffer - Update a buffer's contents from host memory.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCmdUpdateBuffer Update a buffer's contents from host memory.

To update buffer data inline in a command buffer, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCmdUpdateBuffer.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be
    recorded.
  * pname:dstBuffer is a handle to the buffer to be updated.
  * pname:dstOffset is the byte offset into the buffer to start updating,
    and must: be a multiple of 4.
  * pname:dataSize is the number of bytes to update, and must: be a multiple
    of 4.
  * pname:pData is a pointer to the source data for the buffer update, and
    must: be at least pname:dataSize bytes in size.


Description
-----------

pname:dataSize must: be less than or equal to 65536 bytes. For larger
updates, applications can: use buffer to buffer <<copies-buffers,copies>>.

The source data is copied from the user pointer to the command buffer when
the command is called.

fname:vkCmdUpdateBuffer is only allowed outside of a render pass. This
command is treated as ``transfer'' operation, for the purposes of
synchronization barriers. The ename:VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT must:
be specified in pname:usage of slink:VkBufferCreateInfo in order for the
buffer to be compatible with fname:vkCmdUpdateBuffer.
