vkGetDeviceProcAddr(3)
======================

Name
----
vkGetDeviceProcAddr - Return a function pointer for a command

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkGetDeviceProcAddr Return a function pointer for a command

In order to support systems with multiple Vulkan implementations
comprising heterogeneous collections of hardware and software, the function
pointers returned by fname:vkGetInstanceProcAddr may: point to dispatch
code, which calls a different real implementation for different
sname:VkDevice objects (and objects created from them). The overhead of this
internal dispatch can: be avoided by obtaining device-specific function
pointers for any commands that use a device or device-child object as their
dispatchable object. Such function pointers can: be obtained with the
command:

Parameters
----------

The table below defines the various use cases for fname:vkGetDeviceProcAddr
and expected return value for each case.


Description
-----------

The returned function pointer is of type tlink:PFN_vkVoidFunction, and must
be cast to the type of the command being queried.

| pname:device | pname:pName | return value
| NULL | * | undefined
| invalid device | * | undefined

| device | core Vulkan command^1^ | fp
| device | enabled device extension commands for pname:device | fp
| device | * (any pname:pName not covered above) | NULL

1::
pname:pName is the name of any Vulkan command whose first parameter
    is sname:VkDevice or any of its dispatchable children (e.g. sname:VkQueue,
    sname:vkCommandBuffer).
