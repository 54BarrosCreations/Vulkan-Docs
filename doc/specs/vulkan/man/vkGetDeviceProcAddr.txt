vkGetDeviceProcAddr(3)
======================

Name
----
vkGetDeviceProcAddr - Return a function pointer for a command

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkGetDeviceProcAddr Return a function pointer for a command

In order to support systems with multiple Vulkan implementations
comprising heterogeneous collections of hardware and software, the function
pointers returned by fname:vkGetInstanceProcAddr may: point to dispatch
code, which calls a different real implementation for different
sname:VkDevice objects (and objects created from them). The overhead of this
internal dispatch can: be avoided by obtaining device-specific function
pointers for any commands that use a device or device-child object as their
dispatchable object. Such function pointers can: be obtained with the
command:

Parameters
----------

  * pname:device is the logical device that provides the function pointer.
  * pname:pName is the name of any Vulkan command whose first parameter
    is one of
  ** sname:VkDevice
  ** sname:VkQueue
  ** sname:VkCommandBuffer


Description
-----------

The returned function pointer is of type tlink:PFN_vkVoidFunction, and must
be cast to the type of the command being queried.

If pname:pName is not the name of one of these Vulkan commands, and is
not the name of an extension command belonging to an extension enabled for
pname:device, then fname:vkGetDeviceProcAddr will return `NULL`.
