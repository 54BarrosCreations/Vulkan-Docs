========================

Name
----
VkAttachmentReference - Structure specifying an attachment reference

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkAttachmentReference - Structure specifying an attachment reference

The sname:VkAttachmentReference structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkAttachmentReference.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:attachment is the index of the attachment of the render pass, and
    corresponds to the index of the corresponding element in the
    pname:pAttachments array of the sname:VkRenderPassCreateInfo structure.
    If any color or depth/stencil attachments are
    ename:VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED, then no writes occur for those attachments.
  * pname:layout is a elink:VkImageLayout value specifying the layout the
    attachment uses during the subpass. The implementation will
    automatically perform layout transitions as needed between subpasses to
    make each subpass use the requested layouts.
