==================

Name

VkCommandBuffer - Opaque handle to a command buffer object

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkCommandBuffer - Opaque handle to a command buffer object

Command buffers are objects used to record commands which can: be
subsequently submitted to a device queue for execution. There are two levels
of command buffers - _primary command buffers_, which can: execute secondary
command buffers, and which are submitted to queues, and _secondary command
buffers_, which can: be executed by primary command buffers, and which are
not directly submitted to queues.

Command buffers are represented by sname:VkCommandBuffer handles:
