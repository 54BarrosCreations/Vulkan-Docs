vkGetRenderAreaGranularity(3)
=============================

Name
----
vkGetRenderAreaGranularity - Returns the granularity for optimal render area.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkGetRenderAreaGranularity Returns the granularity for optimal render area.

To query the render area granularity, call:

include::../api/protos/vkGetRenderAreaGranularity.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the render pass.
  * pname:renderPass is a handle to a render pass.
  * pname:pGranularity points to a slink:VkExtent2D structure in which the
    granularity is returned.


Description
-----------

The conditions leading to an optimal pname:renderArea are:

  * the pname:offset.x member in pname:renderArea is a multiple of the
    pname:width member of the returned slink:VkExtent2D (the horizontal
    granularity).
  * the pname:offset.y member in pname:renderArea is a multiple of the
    pname:height of the returned slink:VkExtent2D (the vertical
    granularity).
  * either the pname:offset.width member in pname:renderArea is a multiple
    of the horizontal granularity or pname:offset.x+pname:offset.width is
    equal to the pname:width of the pname:framebuffer in the
    slink:VkRenderPassBeginInfo.
  * either the pname:offset.height member in pname:renderArea is a multiple
    of the vertical granularity or pname:offset.y+pname:offset.height is
    equal to the pname:height of the pname:framebuffer in the
    slink:VkRenderPassBeginInfo.

Subpass dependencies are not affected by the render area, and apply to the
entire image subresources attached to the framebuffer. Similarly, pipeline
barriers are valid even if their effect extends outside the render area.
