vkAllocateDescriptorSets(3)
===========================

Name
----
vkAllocateDescriptorSets - Allocate one or more descriptor sets.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkAllocateDescriptorSets Allocate one or more descriptor sets.

To allocate descriptor sets from a descriptor pool, call:

include::../protos/vkAllocateDescriptorSets.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the descriptor pool.
  * pname:pAllocateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    slink:VkDescriptorSetAllocateInfo structure describing parameters of the
    allocation.
  * pname:pDescriptorSets is a pointer to an array of sname:VkDescriptorSet
    handles in which the resulting descriptor set objects are returned. The
    array must: be at least the length specified by the
    pname:descriptorSetCount member of pname:pAllocateInfo.


Description
-----------

The allocated descriptor sets are returned in pname:pDescriptorSets.

When a descriptor set is allocated, the initial state is largely
uninitialized and all descriptors are undefined. However,
the descriptor set can: be bound
in a command buffer without causing errors or exceptions. All entries that
are statically used by a pipeline in a drawing or dispatching command must:
have been populated before the descriptor set is bound for use by that command.
Entries that are not statically used by a pipeline can: have uninitialized
descriptors or descriptors of resources that have been destroyed, and executing
a draw or dispatch with such a descriptor set bound does not cause undefined
behavior. This means applications need not populate unused entries with dummy
descriptors.
