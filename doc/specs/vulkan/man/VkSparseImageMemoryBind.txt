VkSparseImageMemoryBind(3)
==========================

Name
----
VkSparseImageMemoryBind - Structure specifying sparse image memory bind

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkSparseImageMemoryBind - Structure specifying sparse image memory bind

The sname:VkSparseImageMemoryBind structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkSparseImageMemoryBind.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:subresource is the aspectMask and region of interest in the image.
  * pname:offset are the coordinates of the first texel within the image
    subresource to bind.
  * pname:extent is the size in texels of the region within the image
    subresource to bind. The extent must: be a multiple of the sparse image
    block dimensions, except when binding sparse image blocks along the edge
    of an image subresource it can: instead be such that any coordinate of
    latexmath:[$\mathit{offset} + \mathit{extent}$] equals the corresponding
    dimensions of the image subresource.
  * pname:memory is the sname:VkDeviceMemory object that the sparse image
    blocks of the image are bound to. If pname:memory is dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE,
    the sparse image blocks are unbound.
  * pname:memoryOffset is an offset into sname:VkDeviceMemory object. If
    pname:memory is dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE, this value is ignored.
  * pname:flags are sparse memory binding flags.
