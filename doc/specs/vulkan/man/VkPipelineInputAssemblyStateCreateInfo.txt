VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo(3)
=========================================

Name
----
VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created pipeline input assembly state

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created pipeline input assembly state

Each draw is made up of zero or more vertices and zero or more instances,
which are processed by the device and result in the assembly of
primitives. Primitives are assembled according to the
pname:pInputAssemblyState member of the sname:VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo
structure, which is of type sname:VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo:

include::../api/structs/VkPipelineInputAssemblyStateCreateInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:topology is a elink:VkPrimitiveTopology defining the primitive
    topology, as described below.
  * pname:primitiveRestartEnable controls whether a special vertex index
    value is treated as restarting the assembly of primitives. This enable
    only applies to indexed draws (flink:vkCmdDrawIndexed and
    flink:vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect), and the special index value is either
    0xFFFFFFFF when the pname:indexType parameter of
    fname:vkCmdBindIndexBuffer is equal to ename:VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT32, or
    0xFFFF when pname:indexType is equal to ename:VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT16.
    Primitive restart is not allowed for ``list'' topologies.


Description
-----------

Restarting the assembly of primitives discards the most recent index values
if those elements formed an incomplete primitive, and restarts the primitive
assembly using the subsequent indices, but only assembling the immediately
following element through the end of the originally specified elements. The
primitive restart index value comparison is performed before adding the
pname:vertexOffset value to the index value.
