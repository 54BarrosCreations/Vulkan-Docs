vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges(3)
=================================

Name
----
vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges - Invalidate ranges of mapped memory objects.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges Invalidate ranges of mapped memory objects.

To invalidate ranges of non-coherent memory from the host caches, call:

include::../protos/vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the memory ranges.
  * pname:memoryRangeCount is the length of the pname:pMemoryRanges array.
  * pname:pMemoryRanges is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkMappedMemoryRange structures describing the memory ranges to
    invalidate.


Description
-----------

fname:vkInvalidateMappedMemoryRanges must: be used to guarantee that device writes to
non-coherent memory are visible to the host. It must: be called after command buffers
that execute and flush (via memory barriers) the device writes have completed, and
before the host will read or write any of those locations. If a range of non-coherent
memory is written by the host and then invalidated without first being flushed, its
contents are undefined.
