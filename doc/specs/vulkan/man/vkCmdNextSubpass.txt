vkCmdNextSubpass(3)
===================

Name
----
vkCmdNextSubpass - Transition to the next subpass of a render pass.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCmdNextSubpass Transition to the next subpass of a render pass.

To transition to the next subpass in the render pass instance after
recording the commands for a subpass, call:

include::../protos/vkCmdNextSubpass.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer in which to record the
    command.
  * pname:contents specifies how the commands in the next subpass will be
    provided, in the same fashion as the corresponding parameter of
    flink:vkCmdBeginRenderPass.


Description
-----------

The subpass index for a render pass begins at zero when
fname:vkCmdBeginRenderPass is recorded, and increments each time
fname:vkCmdNextSubpass is recorded.

Moving to the next subpass automatically performs any multisample resolve
operations in the subpass being ended. End-of-subpass multisample resolves
are treated as color attachment writes for the purposes of synchronization.
That is, they are considered to execute in the
ename:VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT_BIT pipeline stage and their
writes are synchronized with ename:VK_ACCESS_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_WRITE_BIT.
Synchronization between rendering within a subpass and any resolve
operations at the end of the subpass occurs automatically, without need for
explicit dependencies or pipeline barriers. However, if the resolve
attachment is also used in a different subpass, an explicit dependency is
needed.

After transitioning to the next subpass, the application can: record the
commands for that subpass.
