VkWriteDescriptorSet(3)
=======================

Name
----
VkWriteDescriptorSet - Structure specifying the parameters of a descriptor set write operation.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkWriteDescriptorSet Structure specifying the parameters of a descriptor set write operation.

The sname:VkWriteDescriptorSet structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkWriteDescriptorSet.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:dstSet is the destination descriptor set to update.
  * pname:dstBinding is the descriptor binding within that set.
  * pname:dstArrayElement is the starting element in that array.
  * pname:descriptorCount is the number of descriptors to update (the
    number of elements in pname:pImageInfo, pname:pBufferInfo, or
    pname:pTexelBufferView).
  * pname:descriptorType is a elink:VkDescriptorType
    specifying the type of each descriptor in pname:pImageInfo,
    pname:pBufferInfo, or pname:pTexelBufferView, as described below.
    It must: be the same type
    as that specified in sname:VkDescriptorSetLayoutBinding for
    pname:dstSet at pname:dstBinding. The type of the descriptor also
    controls which array the descriptors are taken from.
  * pname:pImageInfo points to an array of slink:VkDescriptorImageInfo
    structures or is ignored, as described below.
  * pname:pBufferInfo points to an array of slink:VkDescriptorBufferInfo
    structures or is ignored, as described below.
  * pname:pTexelBufferView points to an array of slink:VkBufferView handles
    as described in the <<resources-buffer-views,Buffer Views>> section or
    is ignored, as described below.


Description
-----------

Only one of pname:pImageInfo, pname:pBufferInfo, or pname:pTexelBufferView
members is used according to the descriptor type specified in the
pname:descriptorType member of the containing sname:VkWriteDescriptorSet
structure, as specified below.

[[descriptorsets-updates-consecutive, consecutive binding updates]]
If the pname:dstBinding has fewer than pname:descriptorCount array elements
remaining starting from pname:dstArrayElement, then the remainder will be
used to update the subsequent binding - pname:dstBinding+1 starting at array
element zero. This behavior applies recursively, with the update affecting
consecutive bindings as needed to update all pname:descriptorCount
descriptors. All consecutive bindings updated via a single
sname:VkWriteDescriptorSet structure must: have identical
pname:descriptorType and pname:stageFlags, and must: all either use
immutable samplers or must: all not use immutable samplers.
