vkQueueSubmit(3)
================

Name
----
vkQueueSubmit - Submits a sequence of semaphores or command buffers to a queue.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkQueueSubmit Submits a sequence of semaphores or command buffers to a queue.

To submit command buffers to a queue, call:

include::../protos/vkQueueSubmit.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:queue is the queue that the command buffers will be submitted to.
  * pname:submitCount is the number of elements in the pname:pSubmits array.
  * pname:pSubmits is a pointer to an array of slink:VkSubmitInfo structures,
    each specifying a command buffer submission batch.
  * pname:fence is an optional handle to a fence to be signaled. If
    pname:fence is not dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE, it defines a
    <<synchronization-fences-signaling, fence signal operation>>.


Description
-----------

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Submission can be a high overhead operation, and applications should:
attempt to batch work together into as few calls to fname:vkQueueSubmit as
possible.
====

fname:vkQueueSubmit is a
<<devsandqueues-submission,queue submission command>>, with each batch
defined by an element of pname:pSubmits as an instance of the
slink:VkSubmitInfo structure.

Fence and semaphore operations submitted with flink:vkQueueSubmit have
additional ordering constraints compared to other submission commands,
with dependencies involving previous and subsequent queue operations.
Information about these additional constraints can be found in the
<<synchronization-semaphores, semaphore>> and
<<synchronization-semaphores, fence>> sections of
<<synchronization, the synchronization chapter>>.

Details on the interaction of pname:pWaitDstStageMask with synchronization
are described in the
<<synchronization-semaphores-waiting, semaphore wait operation>> section of
<<synchronization, the synchronization chapter>>.
