vkCmdDrawIndirect(3)
====================

Name
----
vkCmdDrawIndirect - Issue an indirect draw into a command buffer.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCmdDrawIndirect Issue an indirect draw into a command buffer.

To record a non-indexed indirect draw, call:

include::../protos/vkCmdDrawIndirect.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command is
    recorded.
  * pname:buffer is the buffer containing draw parameters.
  * pname:offset is the byte offset into pname:buffer where parameters
    begin.
  * pname:drawCount is the number of draws to execute, and can: be zero.
  * pname:stride is the byte stride between successive sets of draw
    parameters.


Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdDrawIndirect behaves similarly to flink:vkCmdDraw except that the
parameters are read by the device from a buffer during execution.
pname:drawCount draws are executed by the command, with parameters taken
from pname:buffer starting at pname:offset and increasing by pname:stride
bytes for each successive draw. The parameters of each draw are encoded in
an array of slink:VkDrawIndirectCommand structures. If pname:drawCount is
less than or equal to one, pname:stride is ignored.
