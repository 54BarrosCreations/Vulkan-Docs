VkVertexInputBindingDescription(3)
==================================

Name
----
VkVertexInputBindingDescription - Structure specifying vertex input binding description

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkVertexInputBindingDescription - Structure specifying vertex input binding description

The sname:VkVertexInputBindingDescription structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkVertexInputBindingDescription.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:binding is the binding number that this structure
    describes.
  * pname:stride is the distance in bytes between two
    consecutive elements within the buffer.
  * pname:inputRate specifies
    whether vertex attribute addressing is a function of the vertex index or
    of the instance index. Possible values include:
+
--
// refBegin VkVertexInputRate - specify rate at which vertex attributes are pulled from buffers
include::../api/enums/VkVertexInputRate.txt[]
--
  ** ename:VK_VERTEX_INPUT_RATE_VERTEX indicates that vertex attribute
     addressing is a function of the vertex index.
  ** ename:VK_VERTEX_INPUT_RATE_INSTANCE indicates that vertex attribute
     addressing is a function of the instance index.
