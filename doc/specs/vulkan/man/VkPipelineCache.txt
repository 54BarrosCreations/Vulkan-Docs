VkPipelineCache(3)
==================

Name
----
VkPipelineCache - Opaque handle to a pipeline cache object

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkPipelineCache - Opaque handle to a pipeline cache object

Pipeline cache objects allow the result of pipeline construction to be
reused between pipelines and between runs of an application. Reuse between
pipelines is achieved by passing the same pipeline cache object when
creating multiple related pipelines. Reuse across runs of an application is
achieved by retrieving pipeline cache contents in one run of an application,
saving the contents, and using them to preinitialize a pipeline cache on a
subsequent run. The contents of the pipeline cache objects are
managed by the implementation. Applications can: manage the host memory
consumed by a pipeline cache object and control the amount of data
retrieved from a pipeline cache object.

Pipeline cache objects are represented by sname:VkPipelineCache handles:
