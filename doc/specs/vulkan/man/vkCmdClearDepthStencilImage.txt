vkCmdClearDepthStencilImage(3)
==============================

Name
----
vkCmdClearDepthStencilImage - Fill regions of a combined depth-stencil image.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCmdClearDepthStencilImage Fill regions of a combined depth-stencil image.

To clear one or more subranges of a depth/stencil image, call:

include::../protos/vkCmdClearDepthStencilImage.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be
    recorded.
  * pname:image is the image to be cleared.
  * pname:imageLayout specifies the current layout of the image subresource
    ranges to be cleared, and must: be ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL or
    ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_TRANSFER_DST_OPTIMAL.
  * pname:pDepthStencil is a pointer to a slink:VkClearDepthStencilValue
    structure that contains the values the depth and stencil image
    subresource ranges will be cleared to (see <<clears-values>> below).
  * pname:rangeCount is the number of image subresource range structures in
    pname:pRanges.
  * pname:pRanges points to an array of slink:VkImageSubresourceRange
    structures that describe a range of mipmap levels, array layers, and
    aspects to be cleared, as described in <<resources-image-views,Image
    Views>>. The pname:aspectMask of each image subresource range in
    pname:pRanges can: include ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_DEPTH_BIT if the image
    format has a depth component, and ename:VK_IMAGE_ASPECT_STENCIL_BIT if
    the image format has a stencil component. pname:pDepthStencil is a
    pointer to a sname:VkClearDepthStencilValue structure that contains the
    values the image subresource ranges will be cleared to (see
    <<clears-values>> below).
