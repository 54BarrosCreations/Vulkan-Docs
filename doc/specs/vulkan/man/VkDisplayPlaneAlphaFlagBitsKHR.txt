VkDisplayPlaneAlphaFlagBitsKHR(3)
=================================

Name
----
VkDisplayPlaneAlphaFlagBitsKHR - alpha blending type

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkDisplayPlaneAlphaFlagBitsKHR - alpha blending type

Types of alpha blending supported by or used on a display are defined by the
bitmask ename:VkDisplayPlaneAlphaFlagBitsKHR, which contains the following
values:

include::../../api/enums/VkDisplayPlaneAlphaFlagBitsKHR.txt[]


Description
-----------

These values are described as follows:

  * ename:VK_DISPLAY_PLANE_ALPHA_OPAQUE_BIT_KHR: The source image will be
    treated as opaque.
  * ename:VK_DISPLAY_PLANE_ALPHA_GLOBAL_BIT_KHR: A global alpha value must:
    be specified that will be applied to all pixels in the source image.
  * ename:VK_DISPLAY_PLANE_ALPHA_PER_PIXEL_BIT_KHR: The alpha value will be
    determined by the alpha channel of the source image's pixels. If the
    source format contains no alpha values, no blending will be applied.
    The source alpha values are not premultiplied into the source image's
    other color channels.
  * ename:VK_DISPLAY_PLANE_ALPHA_PER_PIXEL_PREMULTIPLIED_BIT_KHR: This is
    equivalent to ename:VK_DISPLAY_PLANE_ALPHA_PER_PIXEL_BIT_KHR except the
    source alpha values are assumed to be premultiplied into the source
    image's other color channels.
