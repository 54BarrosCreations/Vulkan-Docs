==================

Name
----
VkColorSpaceKHR - supported colorspace of the presentation engine

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkColorSpaceKHR - supported colorspace of the presentation engine

The ename:VkColorSpaceKHR is defined as follows:

include::../../api/enums/VkColorSpaceKHR.txt[]


Description
-----------

  * ename:VK_COLOR_SPACE_SRGB_NONLINEAR_KHR: The presentation engine supports
    the sRGB colorspace.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
If pname:pSurfaceFormats includes just one entry, whose value for
pname:format is ename:VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED, pname:surface has no
preferred format.  In this case, the application can use any valid
ename:VkFormat value.
====

[NOTE]
.Note
====
In the initial release of the VK_KHR_surface and VK_KHR_swapchain
extensions, the token ename:VK_COLORSPACE_SRGB_NONLINEAR_KHR was used.
Starting in the May 13, 2016 updates to the extension branches, matching
release 1.0.13 of the core API specification,
ename:VK_COLOR_SPACE_SRGB_NONLINEAR_KHR is used instead for consistency with
Vulkan naming rules. The older enum is still available for backwards
compatibility.
