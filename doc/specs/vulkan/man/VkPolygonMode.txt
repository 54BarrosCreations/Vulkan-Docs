VkPolygonMode(3)
================

Name
----
VkPolygonMode - control polygon rasterization mode

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkPolygonMode control polygon rasterization mode

The method of rasterization for polygons is determined by the
slink:VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo::pname:polygonMode property of
the currently active pipeline, which takes the following values:

include::../api/enums/VkPolygonMode.txt[]


Description
-----------

The pname:polygonMode selects which method of rasterization is used for
polygons. If pname:polygonMode is ename:VK_POLYGON_MODE_POINT, then the
vertices of polygons are treated, for rasterization purposes, as if they had
been drawn as points. ename:VK_POLYGON_MODE_LINE causes polygon edges to be
drawn as line segments. ename:VK_POLYGON_MODE_FILL causes polygons to render
using the polygon rasterization rules in this section.

Note that these modes affect only the final rasterization of polygons: in
particular, a polygon's vertices are shaded and the polygon is clipped and
possibly culled before these modes are applied.
