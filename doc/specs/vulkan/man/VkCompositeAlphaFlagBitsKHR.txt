VkCompositeAlphaFlagBitsKHR(3)
==============================

Name
----
VkCompositeAlphaFlagBitsKHR - alpha compositing modes supported on a device

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkCompositeAlphaFlagBitsKHR - alpha compositing modes supported on a device

The pname:supportedCompositeAlpha member is of type
ename:VkCompositeAlphaFlagBitsKHR, which contains the following values:

include::../api/enums/VkCompositeAlphaFlagBitsKHR.txt[]


Description
-----------

These values are described as follows:

  * ename:VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_OPAQUE_BIT_KHR: The alpha channel, if it
    exists, of the images is ignored in the compositing process.  Instead,
    the image is treated as if it has a constant alpha of 1.0.
  * ename:VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_PRE_MULTIPLIED_BIT_KHR: The alpha channel, if
    it exists, of the images is respected in the compositing process. The
    non-alpha channels of the image are expected to already be multiplied
    by the alpha channel by the application.
  * ename:VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_POST_MULTIPLIED_BIT_KHR: The alpha channel,
    if it exists, of the images is respected in the compositing process.
    The non-alpha channels of the image are not expected to already be
    multiplied by the alpha channel by the application; instead, the
    compositor will multiply the non-alpha channels of the image by the
    alpha channel during compositing.
  * ename:VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_INHERIT_BIT_KHR: The way in which the
    presentation engine treats the alpha channel in the images is unknown
    to the Vulkan API. Instead, the application is responsible for setting
    the composite alpha blending mode using native window system commands.
    If the application does not set the blending mode using native window
    system commands, then a platform-specific default will be used.
