vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties(3)
=====================================

Name
----
vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties - Returns up to requested number of global layer properties.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties Returns up to requested number of global layer properties.

To query the available layers, call:

include::../api/protos/vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:pPropertyCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number of
    layer properties available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pProperties is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkLayerProperties structures.


Description
-----------

If pname:pProperties is `NULL`, then the number of layer properties available
is returned in pname:pPropertyCount. Otherwise, pname:pPropertyCount must:
point to a variable set by the user to the number of elements in the
pname:pProperties array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the
number of structures actually written to pname:pProperties. If
pname:pPropertyCount is less than the number of layer properties available, at
most pname:pPropertyCount structures will be written. If pname:pPropertyCount
is smaller than the number of layers available, ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be
returned instead of ename:VK_SUCCESS, to indicate that not all the available
layer properties were returned.
