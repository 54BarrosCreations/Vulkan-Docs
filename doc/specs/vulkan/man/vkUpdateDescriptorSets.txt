vkUpdateDescriptorSets(3)
=========================

Name
----
vkUpdateDescriptorSets - Update the contents of a descriptor set object.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkUpdateDescriptorSets Update the contents of a descriptor set object.

Once allocated, descriptor sets can: be updated with a combination of write
and copy operations. To update descriptor sets, call:

include::../api/protos/vkUpdateDescriptorSets.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:device is the logical device that updates the descriptor sets.
  * pname:descriptorWriteCount is the number of elements in the
    pname:pDescriptorWrites array.
  * pname:pDescriptorWrites is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkWriteDescriptorSet structures describing the descriptor sets to
    write to.
  * pname:descriptorCopyCount is the number of elements in the
    pname:pDescriptorCopies array.
  * pname:pDescriptorCopies is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkCopyDescriptorSet structures describing the descriptor sets to
    copy between.


Description
-----------

The operations described by pname:pDescriptorWrites are performed first,
followed by the operations described by pname:pDescriptorCopies. Within
each array, the operations are performed in the order they appear in the
array.

Each element in the pname:pDescriptorWrites array describes an operation
updating the descriptor set using descriptors for resources specified in the
structure.

Each element in the pname:pDescriptorCopies array is a
slink:VkCopyDescriptorSet structure describing an operation copying
descriptors between sets.
