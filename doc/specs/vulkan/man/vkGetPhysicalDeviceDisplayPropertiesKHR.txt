vkGetPhysicalDeviceDisplayPropertiesKHR(3)
==========================================

Name
----
vkGetPhysicalDeviceDisplayPropertiesKHR - Query information about the available displays

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkGetPhysicalDeviceDisplayPropertiesKHR - Query information about the available displays

Various functions are provided for enumerating the available display
devices present on a Vulkan physical device.  To query information about
the available displays, call:

include::../../protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceDisplayPropertiesKHR.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:physicalDevice is a physical device.
  * pname:pPropertyCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number of
    display devices available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pProperties is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    sname:VkDisplayPropertiesKHR structures.


Description
-----------

If pname:pProperties is `NULL`, then the number of display devices available
for pname:physicalDevice is returned in pname:pPropertyCount. Otherwise,
pname:pPropertyCount must: point to a variable set by the user to the number
of elements in the pname:pProperties array, and on return the variable is
overwritten with the number of structures actually written to
pname:pProperties. If the value of pname:pPropertyCount is less than the
number of display devices for pname:physicalDevice, at most
pname:pPropertyCount structures will be written.
If pname:pPropertyCount is smaller than the number of display devices
available for pname:physicalDevice, ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned
instead of ename:VK_SUCCESS to indicate that not all the available values
were returned.
