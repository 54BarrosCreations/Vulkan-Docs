vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR(3)
==========================

Name
----
vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR - Obtain the array of presentable images associated with a swapchain

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR - Obtain the array of presentable images associated with a swapchain

To obtain the array of presentable images associated with a swapchain,
call:

include::../../protos/vkGetSwapchainImagesKHR.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:device is the device associated with pname:swapchain.
  * pname:swapchain is the swapchain to query.
  * pname:pSwapchainImageCount is a pointer to an integer related to the
    number of format pairs available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pSwapchainImages is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array
    of sname:VkSwapchainImageKHR structures.


Description
-----------

If pname:pSwapchainImages is `NULL`, then the number of presentable images
for pname:swapchain is returned in pname:pSwapchainImageCount. Otherwise,
pname:pSwapchainImageCount must: point to a variable set by the user to the
number of elements in the pname:pSwapchainImages array, and on return the
variable is overwritten with the number of structures actually written to
pname:pSwapchainImages. If the value of pname:pSwapchainImageCount is less
than the number of presentable images for pname:swapchain, at most
pname:pSwapchainImageCount structures will be written.
If pname:pSwapchainImageCount is smaller than the number of presentable
images for pname:swapchain, ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead of
ename:VK_SUCCESS to indicate that not all the available values were
returned.
