vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties(3)
===========================================

Name
----
vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties - Reports properties of the queues of the specified physical device.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties Reports properties of the queues of the specified physical device.

To query properties of queues available on a physical device, call:

include::../protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceQueueFamilyProperties.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:physicalDevice is the handle to the physical device whose
    properties will be queried.
  * pname:pQueueFamilyPropertyCount is a pointer to an integer related to
    the number of queue families available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pQueueFamilyProperties is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array
    of slink:VkQueueFamilyProperties structures.


Description
-----------

If pname:pQueueFamilyProperties is `NULL`, then the number of queue families
available is returned in pname:pQueueFamilyPropertyCount. Otherwise,
pname:pQueueFamilyPropertyCount must: point to a variable set by the user to
the number of elements in the pname:pQueueFamilyProperties array, and on
return the variable is overwritten with the number of structures actually
written to pname:pQueueFamilyProperties. If
pname:pQueueFamilyPropertyCount is less than the number of queue families
available, at most pname:pQueueFamilyPropertyCount structures will be
written.
