==============================

Name
----
vkGetDeviceMemoryCommitment - Query the current commitment for a VkDeviceMemory

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkGetDeviceMemoryCommitment Query the current commitment for a VkDeviceMemory

To determine the amount of lazily-allocated memory that is currently
committed for a memory object, call:

include::../api/protos/vkGetDeviceMemoryCommitment.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:device is the logical device that owns the memory.
  * pname:memory is the memory object being queried.
  * pname:pCommittedMemoryInBytes is a pointer to a basetype:VkDeviceSize
    value in which the number of bytes currently committed is returned, on
    success.


Description
-----------

The implementation may: update the commitment at any time, and the
value returned by this query may: be out of date.

The implementation guarantees to allocate any committed memory from the
heapIndex indicated by the memory type that the memory object was created
with.
