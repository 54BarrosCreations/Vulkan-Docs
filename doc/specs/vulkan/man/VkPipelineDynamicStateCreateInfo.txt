  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:dynamicStateCount is the number of elements in the
    pname:pDynamicStates array.
  * pname:pDynamicStates is an array of elink:VkDynamicState enums which
    indicate which pieces of pipeline state will use the values from dynamic
