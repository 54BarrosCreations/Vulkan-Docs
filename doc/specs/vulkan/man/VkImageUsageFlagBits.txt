VkImageUsageFlagBits(3)
=======================

Name
----
VkImageUsageFlagBits - Bitmask specifying intended usage of an image

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkImageUsageFlagBits - Bitmask specifying intended usage of an image

The intended usage of an image is specified by the bitmask
slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:usage. Bits which can: be set include:

include::../enums/VkImageUsageFlagBits.txt[]


Description
-----------

These bits have the following meanings:

  * ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT indicates that the image can: be
    used as the source of a transfer command.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT indicates that the image
    can: be used as the destination of a transfer command.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_SAMPLED_BIT indicates that the image can: be used
    to create a sname:VkImageView suitable for occupying a
    sname:VkDescriptorSet slot either of type
    ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SAMPLED_IMAGE or
    ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER, and be sampled by a
    shader.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_STORAGE_BIT indicates that the image can: be used
    to create a sname:VkImageView suitable for occupying a
    sname:VkDescriptorSet slot of type
    ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_IMAGE.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT indicates that the image can:
    be used to create a sname:VkImageView suitable for use as a color or
    resolve attachment in a sname:VkFramebuffer.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT indicates that the
    image can: be used to create a sname:VkImageView suitable for use as a
    depth/stencil attachment in a sname:VkFramebuffer.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSIENT_ATTACHMENT_BIT indicates that the memory
    bound to this image will have been allocated with the
    ename:VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_LAZILY_ALLOCATED_BIT (see <<memory>> for more
    detail). If this is set, then bits other than
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT,
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_BIT, and
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_BIT mustnot: be set.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT_BIT indicates that the image can:
    be used to create a sname:VkImageView suitable for occupying
    sname:VkDescriptorSet slot of type
    ename:VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_INPUT_ATTACHMENT; be read from a shader as an
    input attachment; and be used as an input attachment in a framebuffer.
