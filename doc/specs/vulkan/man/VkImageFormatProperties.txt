VkImageFormatProperties(3)
==========================

Name
----
VkImageFormatProperties - Structure specifying a image format properties

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkImageFormatProperties - Structure specifying a image format properties

The sname:VkImageFormatProperties structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkImageFormatProperties.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:maxExtent are the maximum image dimensions. See the
    <<features-extentperimagetype,Allowed Extent Values>> section below for
    how these values are constrained by pname:type.
  * pname:maxMipLevels is the maximum number of mipmap levels.
    pname:maxMipLevels must: either be equal to 1 (valid only if
    pname:tiling is ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR) or be
    equal to
        latexmath:[$\left\lceil\log_2(\max(
                    \mathit{width},\mathit{height},\mathit{depth}))
                    \right\rceil + 1$]
    where latexmath:[$\mathit{width}$], latexmath:[$\mathit{height}$], and
    latexmath:[$\mathit{depth}$] are taken from the corresponding members of
    pname:maxExtent.
  * pname:maxArrayLayers is the maximum number of array layers.
    pname:maxArrayLayers must: either be equal to 1 or be greater than or
    equal to the pname:maxImageArrayLayers member of
    slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits. A value of 1 is valid only if pname:tiling
    is ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR or if pname:type is
    ename:VK_IMAGE_TYPE_3D.
  * pname:sampleCounts is a bitmask of elink:VkSampleCountFlagBits
    specifying all the supported sample counts for this image as described
    <<features-supported-sample-counts, below>>.
  * pname:maxResourceSize is an upper bound on the total image size in bytes,
    inclusive of all image subresources. Implementations may: have an
    address space limit on total size of a resource, which is advertised by
    this property. pname:maxResourceSize must: be at least 2^31^.


Description
-----------

[NOTE]
.Note
====
There is no mechanism to query the size of an image before creating it, to
compare that size against pname:maxResourceSize. If an application attempts
to create an image that exceeds this limit, the creation will fail or the
image will be invalid. While the advertised limit must: be at least 2^31^,
it may: not be possible to create an image that approaches that size,
particularly for ename:VK_IMAGE_TYPE_1D.
====

If the combination of parameters to
fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties is not supported by the
implementation for use in flink:vkCreateImage, then all members of
sname:VkImageFormatProperties will be filled with zero.
