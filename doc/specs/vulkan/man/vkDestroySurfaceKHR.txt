vkDestroySurfaceKHR(3)
======================

Name
----
vkDestroySurfaceKHR - Destroy a VkSurfaceKHR object

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkDestroySurfaceKHR - Destroy a VkSurfaceKHR object

To destroy a sname:VkSurfaceKHR object, call:

include::../../api/protos/vkDestroySurfaceKHR.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:instance is the instance used to create the surface.
  * pname:surface is the surface to destroy.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).


Description
-----------

Destroying a sname:VkSurfaceKHR merely severs the connection between
Vulkan and the native surface, and doesn't imply destroying the native
surface, closing a window, or similar behavior.
