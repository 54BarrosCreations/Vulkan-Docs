vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties(3)
=========================================

Name
----
vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties - Returns up to requested number of global extension properties.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties Returns up to requested number of global extension properties.

To query the available instance extensions, call:

include::../protos/vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:pLayerName is either `NULL` or a pointer to a null-terminated
    UTF-8 string naming the layer to retrieve extensions from.
  * pname:pPropertyCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number of
    extension properties available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pProperties is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkExtensionProperties structures.


Description
-----------

When pname:pLayerName parameter is NULL, only extensions provided by the Vulkan
implementation or by implicitly enabled layers are returned.
When pname:pLayerName is the name of a layer, the instance extensions
provided by that layer are returned.

If pname:pProperties is `NULL`,
then the number of extensions properties available is returned in
pname:pPropertyCount. Otherwise, pname:pPropertyCount must: point to a
variable set by the user to the number of elements in the pname:pProperties
array, and on return the variable is overwritten with the number of
structures actually written to pname:pProperties. If
pname:pPropertyCount is less than the number of extension properties
available, at most pname:pPropertyCount structures will be written. If
pname:pPropertyCount is smaller than the number of extensions available,
ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead of ename:VK_SUCCESS, to
indicate that not all the available properties were returned.
