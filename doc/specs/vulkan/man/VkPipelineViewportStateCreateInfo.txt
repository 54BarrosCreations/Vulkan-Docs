VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo(3)
====================================

Name
----
VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created pipeline viewport state

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created pipeline viewport state

The sname:VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:viewportCount is the number of viewports used by the pipeline.
  * pname:pViewports is a pointer to an array of slink:VkViewport
    structures, defining the viewport transforms. If the viewport state is
    dynamic, this member is ignored.
  * pname:scissorCount is the number of <<fragops-scissor,scissors>> and
    must: match the number of viewports.
  * pname:pScissors is a pointer to an array of sname:VkRect2D structures
    which define the rectangular bounds of the scissor for the corresponding
    viewport. If the scissor state is dynamic, this member is ignored.
