===========================

Name
----
VkSpecializationMapEntry - Structure specifying a specialization map entry

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkSpecializationMapEntry - Structure specifying a specialization map entry

The sname:VkSpecializationMapEntry structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkSpecializationMapEntry.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:constantID is the ID of the specialization constant in SPIR-V.
  * pname:offset is the byte offset of the specialization constant value within the
    supplied data buffer.
  * pname:size is the byte size of the specialization constant value within the
    supplied data buffer.

If a pname:constantID value is not a specialization constant ID used in the
shader, that map entry does not affect the behavior of the pipeline.
