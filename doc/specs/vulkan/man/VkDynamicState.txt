VkDynamicState(3)
=================

Name
----
VkDynamicState - indicate which dynamic state is taken from dynamic state commands

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkDynamicState - indicate which dynamic state is taken from dynamic state commands

The source of difference pieces of dynamic state is determined by the
slink:VkPipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo::pname:pDynamicStates property of the
currently active pipeline, which takes the following values:

include::../api/enums/VkDynamicState.txt[]


Description
-----------

  * ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT indicates that the pname:pViewports
    state in sname:VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo will be ignored and
    must: be set dynamically with flink:vkCmdSetViewport before any draw
    commands. The number of viewports used by a pipeline is still
    specified by the pname:viewportCount member of
    sname:VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo.
  * ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_SCISSOR indicates that the pname:pScissors
    state in sname:VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo will be ignored and
    must: be set dynamically with flink:vkCmdSetScissor before any draw
    commands. The number of scissor rectangles used by a pipeline is still
    specified by the pname:scissorCount member of
    sname:VkPipelineViewportStateCreateInfo.
  * ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_LINE_WIDTH indicates that the pname:lineWidth
    state in sname:VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo will be ignored
    and must: be set dynamically with flink:vkCmdSetLineWidth before any
    draw commands that generate line primitives for the rasterizer.
  * ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_BIAS indicates that the
    pname:depthBiasConstantFactor, pname:depthBiasClamp and
    pname:depthBiasSlopeFactor states in
    sname:VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo will be ignored and must:
    be set dynamically with flink:vkCmdSetDepthBias before any draws are
    performed with pname:depthBiasEnable in
    sname:VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo set to ename:VK_TRUE.
  * ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_BLEND_CONSTANTS indicates that the
    pname:blendConstants state in
    sname:VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo will be ignored and must: be
    set dynamically with flink:vkCmdSetBlendConstants before any draws are
    performed with a pipeline state with
    sname:VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState member pname:blendEnable set
    to ename:VK_TRUE and any of the blend functions using a constant blend
    color.
  * ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_BOUNDS indicates that the
    pname:minDepthBounds and pname:maxDepthBounds states of
    slink:VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo will be ignored and must:
    be set dynamically with flink:vkCmdSetDepthBounds before any draws are
    performed with a pipeline state with
    sname:VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo member
    pname:depthBoundsTestEnable set to ename:VK_TRUE.
  * ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_STENCIL_COMPARE_MASK indicates that the
    pname:compareMask state in
    sname:VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo for both pname:front and
    pname:back will be ignored and must: be set dynamically with
    flink:vkCmdSetStencilCompareMask before any draws are performed with a
    pipeline state with sname:VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo member
    pname:stencilTestEnable set to ename:VK_TRUE
  * ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_STENCIL_WRITE_MASK indicates that the
    pname:writeMask state in sname:VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo
    for both pname:front and pname:back will be ignored and must: be set
    dynamically with flink:vkCmdSetStencilWriteMask before any draws are
    performed with a pipeline state with
    sname:VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo member
    pname:stencilTestEnable set to ename:VK_TRUE
  * ename:VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_STENCIL_REFERENCE indicates that the
    pname:reference state in sname:VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo
    for both pname:front and pname:back will be ignored and must: be set
    dynamically with flink:vkCmdSetStencilReference before any draws are
    performed with a pipeline state with
    sname:VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo member
    pname:stencilTestEnable set to ename:VK_TRUE
