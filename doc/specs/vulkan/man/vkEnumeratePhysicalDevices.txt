vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices(3)
=============================

Name
----
vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices - Enumerates the physical devices accessible to a Vulkan instance.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices Enumerates the physical devices accessible to a Vulkan instance.

To retrieve a list of physical device objects representing the
physical devices installed in the system, call:

include::../protos/vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:instance is a handle to a Vulkan instance previously created
    with fname:vkCreateInstance.
  * pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount is a pointer to an integer related to the
    number of physical devices available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pPhysicalDevices is either `NULL` or a pointer to an
    array of sname:VkPhysicalDevice handles.


Description
-----------

If pname:pPhysicalDevices is `NULL`, then the number of physical devices
available is returned in pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount. Otherwise,
pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount must: point to a variable set by the user to
the number of elements in the pname:pPhysicalDevices array, and on
return the variable is overwritten with the number of structures actually
written to pname:pPhysicalDevices. If
pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount is less than the number of physical devices
available, at most pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount structures will be
written. If pname:pPhysicalDeviceCount is smaller than the number of
physical devices available, ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned instead of
ename:VK_SUCCESS, to indicate that not all the available physical devices
were returned.
