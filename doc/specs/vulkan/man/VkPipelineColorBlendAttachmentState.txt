VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState(3)
======================================

Name
----
VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState - Structure specifying a pipeline color blend attachment state

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState - Structure specifying a pipeline color blend attachment state

The sname:VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:blendEnable controls whether blending is enabled for the
    corresponding color attachment. If blending is not enabled, the source
    fragment's color for that attachment is passed through unmodified.
  * pname:srcColorBlendFactor selects which blend factor is used to
    determine the source factors latexmath:[$S_r,S_g,S_b$].
  * pname:dstColorBlendFactor selects which blend factor is used to
    determine the destination factors latexmath:[$D_r,D_g,D_b$].
  * pname:colorBlendOp selects which blend operation is used to calculate
    the RGB values to write to the color attachment.
  * pname:srcAlphaBlendFactor selects which blend factor is used to
    determine the source factor latexmath:[$S_a$].
  * pname:dstAlphaBlendFactor selects which blend factor is used to
    determine the destination factor latexmath:[$D_a$].
  * pname:alphaBlendOp selects which blend operation is use to calculate the
    alpha values to write to the color attachment.
  * pname:colorWriteMask is a bitmask selecting which of the R, G, B,
    and/or A components are enabled for writing, as described later in this
    chapter.
