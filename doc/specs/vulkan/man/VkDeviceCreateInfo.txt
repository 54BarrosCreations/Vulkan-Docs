The sname:VkDeviceCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkDeviceCreateInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:queueCreateInfoCount is the unsigned integer size of the
    pname:pQueueCreateInfos array. Refer to the
    <<devsandqueues-queue-creation,Queue Creation>> section below for
    further details.
  * pname:pQueueCreateInfos is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkDeviceQueueCreateInfo structures describing the queues that are
    requested to be created along with the logical device. Refer to the
    <<devsandqueues-queue-creation,Queue Creation>> section below for
    further details.
  * pname:enabledLayerCount is deprecated and ignored.
  * pname:ppEnabledLayerNames is deprecated and ignored. See
    <<extended-functionality-device-layer-deprecation,Device Layer Deprecation>>.
  * pname:enabledExtensionCount is the number of device extensions to
    enable.
  * pname:ppEnabledExtensionNames is a pointer to an array of
    pname:enabledExtensionCount null-terminated UTF-8 strings containing the
    names of extensions to enable for the created device. See the
    <<extended-functionality-extensions,Extensions>> section for further
    details.
  * pname:pEnabledFeatures is `NULL` or a pointer to a
    slink:VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures structure that contains boolean
    indicators of all the features to be enabled. Refer to the
    <<features-features,Features>> section for further details.
