C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkEvent - Opaque handle to a event object

Events represent a fine-grained synchronization primitive that can: be used
to gauge progress through a sequence of commands executed on a queue by
Vulkan. An event is initially in the unsignaled state. It can: be
signaled by a device, using commands inserted into the command buffer, or by
the host. It can: also be reset to the unsignaled state by a device or the
host. The host can: query the state of an event. A device can: wait for one
or more events to become signaled.

Events are represented by sname:VkEvent handles:
