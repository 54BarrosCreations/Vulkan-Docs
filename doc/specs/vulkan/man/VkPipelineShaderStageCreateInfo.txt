VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo(3)
==================================

Name
----
VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created pipeline shader stage

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created pipeline shader stage

The sname:VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:stage names a single pipeline stage. Bits which can:
    be set include:

--
  * pname:module is a sname:VkShaderModule object that contains the
    shader for this stage.
  * pname:pName is a pointer to a null-terminated UTF-8 string specifying
    the entry point name of the shader for this stage.
  * pname:pSpecializationInfo is a pointer to slink:VkSpecializationInfo, as
    described in <<pipelines-specialization-constants,Specialization
    Constants>>, and can: be `NULL`.
