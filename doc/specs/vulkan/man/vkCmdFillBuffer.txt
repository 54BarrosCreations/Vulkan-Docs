vkCmdFillBuffer(3)
==================

Name
----
vkCmdFillBuffer - Fill a region of a buffer with a fixed value.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCmdFillBuffer Fill a region of a buffer with a fixed value.

To clear buffer data, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCmdFillBuffer.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be
    recorded.
  * pname:dstBuffer is the buffer to be filled.
  * pname:dstOffset is the byte offset into the buffer at which to start
    filling, and must: be a multiple of 4.
  * pname:size is the number of bytes to fill, and must: be either a
    multiple of 4, or ename:VK_WHOLE_SIZE to fill the range from
    pname:offset to the end of the buffer. If ename:VK_WHOLE_SIZE is used
    and the remaining size of the buffer is not a multiple of 4, then the
    nearest smaller multiple is used.
  * pname:data is the 4-byte word written repeatedly to the buffer to fill
    pname:size bytes of data. The data word is written to memory according
    to the host endianness.


Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdFillBuffer is treated as ``transfer'' operation for the purposes
of synchronization barriers. The ename:VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT
must: be specified in pname:usage of sname:VkBufferCreateInfo in order for
the buffer to be compatible with fname:vkCmdFillBuffer.
