VkPipelineCacheCreateInfo(3)
============================

Name
----
VkPipelineCacheCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created pipeline cache

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkPipelineCacheCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created pipeline cache

The sname:VkPipelineCacheCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkPipelineCacheCreateInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:initialDataSize is the number of bytes in pname:pInitialData. If
    pname:initialDataSize is zero, the pipeline cache will initially be
    empty.
  * pname:pInitialData is a pointer to previously retrieved pipeline
    cache data. If the pipeline cache data is incompatible (as defined
    below) with the device, the pipeline cache will be initially empty. If
    pname:initialDataSize is zero, pname:pInitialData is ignored.
