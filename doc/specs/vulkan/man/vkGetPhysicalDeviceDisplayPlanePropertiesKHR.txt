vkGetPhysicalDeviceDisplayPlanePropertiesKHR(3)
===============================================

Name
----
vkGetPhysicalDeviceDisplayPlanePropertiesKHR - Query the plane properties

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkGetPhysicalDeviceDisplayPlanePropertiesKHR - Query the plane properties

Images are presented to individual planes on a display.  Devices must:
support at least one plane on each display.  Planes can: be stacked and
blended to composite multiple images on one display.  Devices may: support
only a fixed stacking order and fixed mapping between planes and displays,
or they may: allow arbitrary application specified stacking orders and
mappings between planes and displays. To query the properties of device
display planes, call:

include::../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceDisplayPlanePropertiesKHR.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:physicalDevice is a physical device.
  * pname:pPropertyCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number of
    display planes available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pProperties is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    sname:VkDisplayPlanePropertiesKHR structures.


Description
-----------

If pname:pProperties is `NULL`, then the number of display planes available
for pname:physicalDevice is returned in pname:pPropertyCount. Otherwise,
pname:pPropertyCount must: point to a variable set by the user to the number
of elements in the pname:pProperties array, and on return the variable is
overwritten with the number of structures actually written to
pname:pProperties. If the value of pname:pPropertyCount is less than the
number of display planes for pname:physicalDevice, at most
pname:pPropertyCount structures will be written.
