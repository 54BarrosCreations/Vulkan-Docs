VkPhysicalDevice - Opaque handle to a physical device object

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkPhysicalDevice - Opaque handle to a physical device object

Vulkan separates the concept of _physical_ and _logical_ devices. A
physical device usually represents a single device in a system (perhaps made
up of several individual hardware devices working together), of which there
are a finite number. A logical device represents an application's view of
the device.

Physical devices are represented by sname:VkPhysicalDevice handles:
