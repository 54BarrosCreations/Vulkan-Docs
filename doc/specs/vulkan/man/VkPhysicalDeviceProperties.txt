C Specification

// refBegin VkPhysicalDeviceProperties - Structure specifying physical device properties

The sname:VkPhysicalDeviceProperties structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkPhysicalDeviceProperties.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:apiVersion is the version of Vulkan supported by the device,
    encoded as described in the <<fundamentals-versionnum,API Version
    Numbers and Semantics>> section.
  * pname:driverVersion is the vendor-specified version of the driver.
  * pname:vendorID is a unique identifier for the _vendor_ (see below) of
    the physical device.
  * pname:deviceID is a unique identifier for the physical device among
    devices available from the vendor.
  * pname:deviceType is a elink:VkPhysicalDeviceType specifying the type of
    device.
  * pname:deviceName is a null-terminated UTF-8 string containing the name
    of the device.
  * pname:pipelineCacheUUID is an array of size ename:VK_UUID_SIZE,
    containing 8-bit values that represent a universally unique identifier
    for the device.
  * pname:limits is the slink:VkPhysicalDeviceLimits structure which
    specifies device-specific limits of the physical device. See
    <<features-limits,Limits>> for details.
  * pname:sparseProperties is the slink:VkPhysicalDeviceSparseProperties
    structure which specifies various sparse related properties of the
    physical device. See <<sparsememory-physicalprops,Sparse Properties>>
    for details.


Description
-----------

The pname:vendorID and pname:deviceID fields are provided to allow
applications to adapt to device characteristics that are not
adequately exposed by other Vulkan queries. These may: include
performance profiles, hardware errata, or other characteristics.
In PCI-based implementations, the low sixteen bits of pname:vendorID
and pname:deviceID must: contain (respectively) the PCI vendor and
device IDs associated with the hardware device, and the remaining bits
must: be set to zero. In non-PCI implementations, the choice of what values
to return may: be dictated by operating system or platform policies. It is
otherwise at the discretion of the implementer, subject to the following
constraints and guidelines:

  * For purposes of physical device identification, the _vendor_ of a
    physical device is the entity responsible for the most salient
    characteristics of the hardware represented by the physical device
    handle. In the case of a discrete GPU, this should: be the GPU
    chipset vendor. In the case of a GPU or other accelerator integrated
    into a system-on-chip (SoC), this should: be the supplier of the
    silicon IP used to create the GPU or other accelerator.
  * If the vendor of the physical device has a valid PCI vendor ID issued by
    https://pcisig.com/[PCI-SIG], that ID should: be used to construct
    pname:vendorID as described above for PCI-based
    implementations. Implementations that do not return a PCI vendor ID in
    pname:vendorID must: return a valid Khronos vendor ID, obtained as
    defined in the <<extensions-vendor-id,Registering a Vendor ID with
    Khronos>> section. Khronos vendor IDs are allocated starting at 0x10000,
    to distinguish them from the PCI vendor ID namespace.
  * The vendor of the physical device is responsible for selecting
    pname:deviceID. The value selected should: uniquely
    identify both the device version and any major configuration options
    (for example, core count in the case of multicore devices). The same
    device ID should: be used for all physical implementations of that
    device version and configuration. For example, all uses of a
    specific silicon IP GPU version and configuration should use the
    same device ID, even if those uses occur in different SoCs.
