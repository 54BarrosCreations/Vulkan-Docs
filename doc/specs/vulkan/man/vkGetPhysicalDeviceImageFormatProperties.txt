vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties(3)
===========================================

Name
----
vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties - Lists physical device's image format capabilities.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties Lists physical device's image format capabilities.

To query additional capabilities specific to image types, call:

include::../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device from which to query the
    image capabilities.
  * pname:format is the image format, corresponding to
    slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:format.
  * pname:type is the image type, corresponding to
    slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:imageType.
  * pname:tiling is the image tiling, corresponding to
    slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:tiling.
  * pname:usage is the intended usage of the image, corresponding to
    slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:usage.
  * pname:flags is a bitmask describing additional parameters of the image,
    corresponding to slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:flags.
  * pname:pImageFormatProperties points to an instance of the
    slink:VkImageFormatProperties structure in which capabilities are
    returned.


Description
-----------

The pname:format, pname:type, pname:tiling, pname:usage, and pname:flags
parameters correspond to parameters that would be consumed by
flink:vkCreateImage.

If pname:format is not a supported image format, or if the combination of
pname:format, pname:type, pname:tiling, pname:usage, and pname:flags is not
supported for images, then fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties
returns ename:VK_ERROR_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED.

The limitations on an image format that are reported by
fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties have the following property:
if code:usage1 and code:usage2 of type elink:VkImageUsageFlags are such that
the bits set in code:usage1 are a subset of the bits set in code:usage2, and
code:flags1 and code:flags2 of type elink:VkImageCreateFlags are such that
the bits set in code:flags1 are a subset of the bits set in code:flags2,
then the limitations for code:usage1 and code:flags1 must: be no more strict
than the limitations for code:usage2 and code:flags2, for all values of
pname:format, pname:type, and pname:tiling.
