To create graphics pipelines, call:

include::../protos/vkCreateGraphicsPipelines.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:device is the logical device that creates the graphics pipelines.
  * pname:pipelineCache is either dlink:VK_NULL_HANDLE, indicating that
    pipeline caching is disabled; or the handle of a valid
    <<pipelines-cache,pipeline cache>> object, in which case use of that
    cache is enabled for the duration of the command.
  * pname:createInfoCount is the length of the pname:pCreateInfos and
    pname:pPipelines arrays.
  * pname:pCreateInfos is an array of sname:VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo
    structures.
  * pname:pAllocator controls host memory allocation as described in the
    <<memory-allocation, Memory Allocation>> chapter.
  * pname:pPipelines is a pointer to an array in which the resulting
    graphics pipeline objects are returned.
