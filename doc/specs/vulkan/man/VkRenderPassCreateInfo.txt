=========================

Name
----
VkRenderPassCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created render pass

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkRenderPassCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created render pass

The sname:VkRenderPassCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkRenderPassCreateInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:attachmentCount is the number of attachments used by this
    render pass, or zero indicating no attachments. Attachments are referred
    to by zero-based indices in the range [0,pname:attachmentCount).
  * pname:pAttachments points to an array of pname:attachmentCount number of
    slink:VkAttachmentDescription structures describing properties of the
    attachments, or `NULL` if pname:attachmentCount is zero.
  * pname:subpassCount is the number of subpasses to create for this render
    pass. Subpasses are referred to by zero-based indices in the range
    [0,pname:subpassCount). A render pass must: have at least one subpass.
  * pname:pSubpasses points to an array of pname:subpassCount number of
    slink:VkSubpassDescription structures describing properties of the
    subpasses.
  * pname:dependencyCount is the number of dependencies between pairs of
    subpasses, or zero indicating no dependencies.
  * pname:pDependencies points to an array of pname:dependencyCount number
    of slink:VkSubpassDependency structures describing dependencies
    between pairs of subpasses, or `NULL` if pname:dependencyCount is zero.
