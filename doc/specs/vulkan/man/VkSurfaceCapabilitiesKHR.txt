VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR(3)
===========================

Name
----
VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR - Structure describing capabilities of a surface

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR - Structure describing capabilities of a surface

The sname:VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:minImageCount is the minimum number of images the specified device
    supports for a swapchain created for the surface.
  * pname:maxImageCount is the maximum number of images the specified device
    supports for a swapchain created for the surface.  A value of `0` means
    that there is no limit on the number of images, though there may: be
    limits related to the total amount of memory used by swapchain images.
  * pname:currentExtent is the current width and height of the surface, or
    the special value latexmath:[$(0xFFFFFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF)$] indicating that
    the surface size will be determined by the extent of a swapchain
    targeting the surface.
  * pname:minImageExtent contains the smallest valid swapchain extent for
    the surface on the specified device.
  * pname:maxImageExtent contains the largest valid swapchain extent for
    the surface on the specified device.
  * pname:maxImageArrayLayers is the maximum number of layers swapchain
    images can: have for a swapchain created for this device and surface.
  * pname:supportedTransforms is a bitfield of
    elink:VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR, describing the presentation
    transforms supported for the surface on the specified device.
  * pname:currentTransform is a bitfield of
    elink:VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR, describing the surface's current
    transform relative to the presentation engine's natural orientation.
  * pname:supportedCompositeAlpha is a bitfield of
    elink:VkCompositeAlphaFlagBitsKHR, representing the
    alpha compositing modes supported by the presentation engine for the
    surface on the specified device.  Opaque composition can: be achieved in
    any alpha compositing mode by either using a swapchain image format that
    has no alpha component, or by ensuring that all pixels in the swapchain
    images have an alpha value of 1.0.
  * pname:supportedUsageFlags is a bitfield of elink:VkImageUsageFlagBits
    representing the ways the application can: use the presentable images of
    a swapchain created for the surface on the specified device.
    ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_BIT must: be included in the set
    but implementations may: support additional usages.
