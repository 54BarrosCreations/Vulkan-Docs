VkDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR(3)
================================

Name
----
VkDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR - Structure describing capabilities of a mode and plane combination

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR - Structure describing capabilities of a mode and plane combination

The sname:VkDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:supportedAlpha is a bitmask of
    elink:VkDisplayPlaneAlphaFlagBitsKHR describing the supported alpha
    blending modes.
  * pname:minSrcPosition is the minimum source rect offset supported by this
    plane using the specified mode.
  * pname:maxSrcPosition is the maximum source rect offset supported by this
    plane using the specified mode.  The x and y offets must: be >= 0.
  * pname:maxSrcPosition is the maximum source rect offset supported by this
    plane using the specified mode.  The x and y offsets must: be >=
    pname:minSrcPosition.
  * pname:minSrcExtent is the minimum source rect size supported by this
    plane using the specified mode.
  * pname:maxSrcExtent is the maximum source rect size supported by this
    plane using the specified mode.
  * pname:minDstPosition, pname:maxDstPosition, pname:minDstExtent,
    pname:maxDstExtent all have similar semantics to their corresponding
    "Src" equivalents, but apply to the output region within the mode rather
    than the input region within the source image. Unlike the "Src" offsets,
    pname:minDstPosition and pname:maxDstPosition may: contain negative
    values.


Description
-----------

The minimum and maximum position and extent fields describe the hardware
limits, if any, as they apply to the specified display mode and plane.
Vendors may: support displaying a subset of a swapchain's presentable images
on the specified display plane. This is expressed by returning
pname:minSrcPosition, pname:maxSrcPosition, pname:minSrcExtent, and
pname:maxSrcExtent values that indicate a range of possible positions and
sizes may: be used to specify the region within the presentable images that
source pixels will be read from when creating a swapchain on the specified
display mode and plane.

Vendors may: also support mapping the presentable images' content to a
subset or superset of the visible region in the specified display mode. This
is expressed by returning pname:minDstPosition, pname:maxDstPosition,
pname:minDstExtent and pname:maxDstExtent values that indicate a range of
possible positions and sizes may: be used to describe the region within the
display mode that the source pixels will be mapped to.

Other vendors may: support only a 1-1 mapping between pixels in the
presentable images and the display mode. This may: be indicated by returning
(0,0) for pname:minSrcPosition, pname:maxSrcPosition, pname:minDstPosition,
and pname:maxDstPosition, and (display mode width, display mode height) for
pname:minSrcExtent, pname:maxSrcExtent, pname:minDstExtent, and
pname:maxDstExtent.

These values indicate the limits of the hardware's individual fields. Not
all combinations of values within the offset and extent ranges returned in
sname:VkDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR are guaranteed to be supported. Vendors
may: still fail presentation requests that specify unsupported combinations.
