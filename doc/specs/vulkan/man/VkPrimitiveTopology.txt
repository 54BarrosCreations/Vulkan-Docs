VkPrimitiveTopology(3)
======================

Name
----
VkPrimitiveTopology - supported primitive topologies

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkPrimitiveTopology supported primitive topologies

_Primitive topology_ determines how consecutive vertices are organized into
primitives, and determines the type of primitive that is used at the
beginning of the graphics pipeline. The effective topology for later stages
of the pipeline is altered by tessellation or geometry shading (if either is
in use) and depends on the execution modes of those shaders. Supported
topologies are defined by elink:VkPrimitiveTopology and include:

include::../api/enums/VkPrimitiveTopology.txt[]


Description
-----------

// refEnd VkPrimitiveTopology
