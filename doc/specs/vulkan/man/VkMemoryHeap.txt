===============

Name
----
VkMemoryHeap - Structure specifying a memory heap

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkMemoryHeap - Structure specifying a memory heap

The sname:VkMemoryHeap structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkMemoryHeap.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:size is the total memory size in bytes in the heap.
  * pname:flags is a bitmask of attribute flags for the heap. The bits
    specified in pname:flags are:

--
  ** if pname:flags contains ename:VK_MEMORY_HEAP_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT, it means
     the heap corresponds to device local memory. Device local memory may:
     have different performance characteristics than host local memory, and
     may: support different memory property flags.
