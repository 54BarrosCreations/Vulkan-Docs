VkImageCreateFlagBits(3)
========================

Name
----
VkImageCreateFlagBits - Bitmask specifying additional parameters of an image

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkImageCreateFlagBits - Bitmask specifying additional parameters of an image

Additional parameters of an image are specified by
slink:VkImageCreateInfo::pname:flags. Bits which can: be set include:

include::../enums/VkImageCreateFlagBits.txt[]


Description
-----------

These bits have the following meanings:

  * ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_BINDING_BIT indicates that the image will
    be backed using sparse memory binding.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_RESIDENCY_BIT indicates that the image can:
    be partially backed using sparse memory binding. Images created with
    this flag must: also be created with the
    ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_BINDING_BIT flag.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_ALIASED_BIT indicates that the image will
    be backed using sparse memory binding with memory ranges that might also
    simultaneously be backing another image (or another portion of the same
    image). Images created with this flag must: also be created with the
    ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_BINDING_BIT flag
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_MUTABLE_FORMAT_BIT indicates that the image can:
    be used to create a sname:VkImageView with a different format from the
    image.
  * ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_CUBE_COMPATIBLE_BIT indicates that the image can:
    be used to create a sname:VkImageView of type
    ename:VK_IMAGE_VIEW_TYPE_CUBE or ename:VK_IMAGE_VIEW_TYPE_CUBE_ARRAY.

If any of the bits ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_BINDING_BIT,
ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_RESIDENCY_BIT, or
ename:VK_IMAGE_CREATE_SPARSE_ALIASED_BIT are set,
ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSIENT_ATTACHMENT_BIT mustnot: also be set.

<<sparsememory-physicalfeatures,Sparse Physical Device Features>> for
