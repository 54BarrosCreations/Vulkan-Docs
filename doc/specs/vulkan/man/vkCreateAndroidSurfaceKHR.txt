vkCreateAndroidSurfaceKHR(3)
============================

Name
----
vkCreateAndroidSurfaceKHR - Create a slink:VkSurfaceKHR object for an Android native window

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCreateAndroidSurfaceKHR - Create a slink:VkSurfaceKHR object for an Android native window

To create a sname:VkSurfaceKHR object for an Android native window, call:

include::../../api/protos/vkCreateAndroidSurfaceKHR.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:instance is the instance to associate the surface with.
  * pname:pCreateInfo is a pointer to an instance of the
    sname:VkAndroidSurfaceCreateInfoKHR structure containing parameters
    affecting the creation of the surface object.
  * pname:pAllocator is the allocator used for host memory allocated for the
    surface object when there is no more specific allocator available (see
    <<memory-allocation,Memory Allocation>>).
  * pname:pSurface points to a sname:VkSurfaceKHR handle in which the
    created surface object is returned.


Description
-----------

During the lifetime of a surface created using a particular ANativeWindow
handle any attempts to create another surface for the same ANativeWindow and
any attempts to connect to the same ANativeWindow through other platform
mechanisms will fail.

[NOTE]
.NOTE
====
In particular, only one sname:VkSurfaceKHR can: exist at a time for a given
window.  Similarly, a native window cannot: be used by both a
sname:VkSurfaceKHR and EGLSurface simultaneously.
====

If successful, fname:vkCreateAndroidSurfaceKHR increments the
ANativeWindow's reference count, and fname:vkDestroySurfaceKHR will
decrement it.

On Android, when a swapchain's pname:imageExtent does not match the
surface's pname:currentExtent, the swapchain images will be scaled to the
surface's dimensions during presentation. pname:minImageExtent is
latexmath:[$(1, 1)$], and pname:maxImageExtent is the maximum image size
supported by the consumer. For the system compositor, pname:currentExtent is
the window size (i.e. the consumer's preferred size).
