vkCmdDrawIndexed(3)
===================

Name
----
vkCmdDrawIndexed - Issue an indexed draw into a command buffer.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCmdDrawIndexed Issue an indexed draw into a command buffer.

To record an indexed draw, call:

include::../protos/vkCmdDrawIndexed.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command is
    recorded.
  * pname:indexCount is the number of vertices to draw.
  * pname:instanceCount is the number of instances to draw.
  * pname:firstIndex is the base index within the index buffer.
  * pname:vertexOffset is the value added to the vertex index before indexing
    into the vertex buffer.
  * pname:firstInstance is the instance ID of the first instance to draw.


Description
-----------

When the command is executed, primitives are assembled using the current
primitive topology and pname:indexCount vertices whose indices are retrieved
from the index buffer. The index buffer is treated as an array of tightly
packed unsigned integers of size defined by the
flink:vkCmdBindIndexBuffer::pname:indexType parameter with which the buffer
was bound.

The first vertex index is at an offset of pname:firstIndex * code:indexSize
+ pname:offset within the currently bound index buffer, where pname:offset
is the offset specified by fname:vkCmdBindIndexBuffer and code:indexSize is
the byte size of the type specified by pname:indexType. Subsequent index
values are retrieved from consecutive locations in the index buffer. Indices
are first compared to the primitive restart value, then zero extended to 32
bits (if the code:indexType is ename:VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT16) and have
pname:vertexOffset added to them, before being supplied as the
code:vertexIndex value.

The primitives are drawn pname:instanceCount times with code:instanceIndex
starting with pname:firstInstance and increasing sequentially for each
instance. The assembled primitives execute the currently bound graphics
pipeline.
