VkImageCreateInfo(3)
====================

Name
----
VkImageCreateInfo - Structure specifying the parameters of a newly created image object.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkImageCreateInfo Structure specifying the parameters of a newly created image object.

The sname:VkImageCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkImageCreateInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is a bitmask describing additional parameters of the image.
    See elink:VkImageCreateFlagBits below for a description of the supported
    bits.
  * pname:imageType is a elink:VkImageType specifying the basic
    dimensionality of the image, as described below. Layers in array
    textures do not count as a dimension for the purposes of the image type.
  * pname:format is a elink:VkFormat describing the format and type of the
    data elements that will be contained in the image.
  * pname:extent is a slink:VkExtent3D describing the number of data
    elements in each dimension of the base level.
  * pname:mipLevels describes the number of levels of detail available for
    minified sampling of the image.
  * pname:arrayLayers is the number of layers in the image.
  * pname:samples is the number of sub-data element samples in the image as
    defined in elink:VkSampleCountFlagBits. See
    <<primsrast-multisampling,Multisampling>>.
  * pname:tiling is a elink:VkImageTiling specifying the tiling arrangement
    of the data elements in memory, as described below.
  * pname:usage is a bitmask describing the intended usage of the image.
    See elink:VkImageUsageFlagBits below for a description of the supported
    bits.
  * pname:sharingMode is the sharing mode of the image when it will be
    accessed by multiple queue families, and must: be one of the values
    described for elink:VkSharingMode in the <<resources-sharing,Resource
    Sharing>> section below.
  * pname:queueFamilyIndexCount is the number of entries in the
    pname:pQueueFamilyIndices array.
  * pname:pQueueFamilyIndices is a list of queue families that will
    access this image (ignored if pname:sharingMode is not
    ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT).
  * pname:initialLayout selects the initial elink:VkImageLayout state of all
    image subresources of the image. See <<resources-image-layouts,Image
    Layouts>>. pname:initialLayout must: be ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED
    or ename:VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PREINITIALIZED.


Description
-----------

Valid limits for the image pname:extent, pname:mipLevels, pname:arrayLayers
and pname:samples members are queried with the
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties command.

Images created with pname:tiling equal to ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR have
further restrictions on their limits and capabilities compared to images
created with pname:tiling equal to ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_OPTIMAL. Creation
of images with tiling ename:VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR may: not be supported
unless other parameters meet all of the constraints:

  * pname:imageType is ename:VK_IMAGE_TYPE_2D
  * pname:format is not a depth/stencil format
  * pname:mipLevels is 1
  * pname:arrayLayers is 1
  * pname:samples is ename:VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT
  * pname:usage only includes ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT
    and/or ename:VK_IMAGE_USAGE_TRANSFER_DST_BIT

Implementations may: support additional limits and capabilities beyond those
listed above. To determine the specific capabilities of an implementation,
query the valid pname:usage bits by calling
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties and the valid limits for
pname:mipLevels and pname:arrayLayers by calling
flink:vkGetPhysicalDeviceImageFormatProperties.
