vkCmdPipelineBarrier(3)
=======================

Name
----
vkCmdPipelineBarrier - Insert a set of execution and memory barriers.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCmdPipelineBarrier Insert a set of execution and memory barriers.

To record a pipeline barrier, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCmdPipelineBarrier.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command is
    recorded.
  * pname:srcStageMask is a bitmask of elink:VkPipelineStageFlagBits
    specifying a set of source pipeline stages (see
    <<synchronization-pipeline-stage-flags>>).
  * pname:dstStageMask is a bitmask specifying a set of destination pipeline
    stages.
+
The pipeline barrier specifies an execution dependency such that all
work performed by the set of pipeline stages included in
pname:srcStageMask of the first set of commands completes before any
work performed by the set of pipeline stages included in
pname:dstStageMask of the second set of commands begins.
+
  * pname:dependencyFlags is a bitmask of elink:VkDependencyFlagBits. The
    execution dependency is by-region if the mask includes
    ename:VK_DEPENDENCY_BY_REGION_BIT.
  * pname:memoryBarrierCount is the length of the pname:pMemoryBarriers
    array.
  * pname:pMemoryBarriers is a pointer to an array of slink:VkMemoryBarrier
    structures.
  * pname:bufferMemoryBarrierCount is the length of the
    pname:pBufferMemoryBarriers array.
  * pname:pBufferMemoryBarriers is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkBufferMemoryBarrier structures.
  * pname:imageMemoryBarrierCount is the length of the
    pname:pImageMemoryBarriers array.
  * pname:pImageMemoryBarriers is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkImageMemoryBarrier structures.


Description
-----------

Each element of the pname:pMemoryBarriers, pname:pBufferMemoryBarriers and
pname:pImageMemoryBarriers arrays specifies two halves of a memory
dependency, as defined above. Specifics of each type of memory barrier and
the memory access types are defined further in
<<synchronization-memory-barriers,Memory Barriers>>.

If fname:vkCmdPipelineBarrier is called outside a render pass instance, then
the first set of commands is all prior commands submitted to the queue and
recorded in the command buffer and the second set of commands is all
subsequent commands recorded in the command buffer and submitted to the
queue. If fname:vkCmdPipelineBarrier is called inside a render pass
instance, then the first set of commands is all prior commands in the same
subpass and the second set of commands is all subsequent commands in the
same subpass.
