VkSubmitInfo - Structure specifying a queue submit operation

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkSubmitInfo - Structure specifying a queue submit operation

The sname:VkSubmitInfo structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkSubmitInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:waitSemaphoreCount is the number of semaphores upon which
    to wait before executing the command buffers for the batch.
  * pname:pWaitSemaphores is a pointer to an array of semaphores upon which
    to wait before the command buffers for this batch begin execution. If
    semaphores to wait on are provided, they define a
    <<synchronization-semaphores-waiting, semaphore wait operation>>.
  * pname:pWaitDstStageMask is a pointer to an array of pipeline stages at
    which each corresponding semaphore wait will occur.
  * pname:commandBufferCount is the number of command buffers to
    execute in the batch.
  * pname:pCommandBuffers is a pointer to an array of command buffers to
    execute in the batch. The command buffers submitted in a batch begin
    execution in the order they appear in pname:pCommandBuffers, but may:
    complete out of order.
  * pname:signalSemaphoreCount is the number of semaphores to be
    signaled once the commands specified in pname:pCommandBuffers have
    completed execution.
  * pname:pSignalSemaphores is a pointer to an array of semaphores which
    will be signaled when the command buffers for this batch have completed
    execution. If semaphores to be signaled are provided, they define a
    <<synchronization-semaphores-signaling, semaphore signal operation>>.
