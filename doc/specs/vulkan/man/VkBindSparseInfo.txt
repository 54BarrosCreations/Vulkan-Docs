VkBindSparseInfo(3)
===================

Name
----
VkBindSparseInfo - Structure specifying a sparse binding operation

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkBindSparseInfo - Structure specifying a sparse binding operation

The sname:VkBindSparseInfo structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkBindSparseInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:waitSemaphoreCount is the number of semaphores upon which to
    wait before executing the sparse binding operations for the batch.
  * pname:pWaitSemaphores is a pointer to an array of semaphores upon which
    to wait on before the sparse binding operations for this batch begin
    execution. If semaphores to wait on are provided, they define a
    <<synchronization-semaphores-waiting, semaphore wait operation>>.
  * pname:bufferBindCount is the number of sparse buffer bindings to
    perform in the batch.
  * pname:pBufferBinds is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkSparseBufferMemoryBindInfo structures.
  * pname:imageOpaqueBindCount is the number of opaque sparse image bindings
    to perform.
  * pname:pImageOpaqueBinds is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkSparseImageOpaqueMemoryBindInfo structures, indicating opaque
    sparse image bindings to perform.
  * pname:imageBindCount is the number of sparse image bindings to perform.
  * pname:pImageBinds is a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkSparseImageMemoryBindInfo structures, indicating sparse image
    bindings to perform.
  * pname:signalSemaphoreCount is the number of semaphores to be
    signaled once the sparse binding operations specified by the structure
    have completed execution.
  * pname:pSignalSemaphores is a pointer to an array of semaphores which
    will be signaled when the sparse binding operations for this batch have
    completed execution.
    If semaphores to be signaled are provided, they define a
    <<synchronization-semaphores-signaling, semaphore signal operation>>.
