vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR(3)
=======================================

Name
----
vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR - Query color formats supported by surface

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR - Query color formats supported by surface

To query the supported swapchain format-colorspace pairs for a surface,
call:

include::../../api/protos/vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device that will be associated with
    the swapchain to be created, as described for
    flink:vkCreateSwapchainKHR.
  * pname:surface is the surface that will be associated with the swapchain.
  * pname:pSurfaceFormatCount is a pointer to an integer related to the
    number of format pairs available or queried, as described below.
  * pname:pSurfaceFormats is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array
    of sname:VkSurfaceFormatKHR structures.


Description
-----------

If pname:pSurfaceFormats is `NULL`, then the number of format pairs
supported for the given pname:surface is returned in
pname:pSurfaceFormatCount. Otherwise, pname:pSurfaceFormatCount must: point
to a variable set by the user to the number of elements in the
pname:pSurfaceFormats array, and on return the variable is overwritten with
the number of structures actually written to pname:pSurfaceFormats. If the
value of pname:pSurfaceFormatCount is less than the number of format pairs
supported, at most pname:pSurfaceFormatCount structures will be written.
If pname:pSurfaceFormatCount is smaller than the number of format pairs
supported for the given pname:surface, ename:VK_INCOMPLETE will be returned
instead of ename:VK_SUCCESS to indicate that not all the available values
were returned.
