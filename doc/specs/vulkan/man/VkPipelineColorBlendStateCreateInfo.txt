VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo(3)
======================================

Name
----
VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created pipeline color blend state

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created pipeline color blend state

The sname:VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../api/structs/VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:logicOpEnable controls whether to apply <<framebuffer-logicop,
    Logical Operations>>.
  * pname:logicOp selects which logical operation to apply.
  * pname:attachmentCount is the number of
    sname:VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState elements in
    pname:pAttachments. This value must: equal the
    pname:colorAttachmentCount for the subpass in which this pipeline is
    used.
  * pname:pAttachments: is a pointer to array of per target attachment states.
  * pname:blendConstants is an array of four values used as the R, G, B, and
    A components of the blend constant that are used in blending, depending
    on the <<framebuffer-blendfactors,blend factor>>.


Description
-----------

Each element of the pname:pAttachments array is a
slink:VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState structure specifying per-target
blending state for each individual color attachment. If the
<<features-features-independentBlend,independent blending>> feature is not
enabled on the device, all slink:VkPipelineColorBlendAttachmentState
elements in the pname:pAttachments array must: be identical.
