=======================================

Name
----
vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties - Returns properties of available physical device extensions.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties Returns properties of available physical device extensions.

To query the extensions available to a given physical device, call:

include::../protos/vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device that will be queried.
  * pname:pLayerName is either `NULL` or a pointer to a null-terminated
    UTF-8 string naming the layer to retrieve extensions from.
  * pname:pPropertyCount is a pointer to an integer related to the number of
    extension properties available or queried, and is treated in the same
    fashion as the
    flink:vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties::pname:pPropertyCount
    parameter.
  * pname:pProperties is either `NULL` or a pointer to an array of
    slink:VkExtensionProperties structures.


Description
-----------

When pname:pLayerName parameter is NULL, only extensions provided by the Vulkan
implementation or by implicitly enabled layers are returned.
When pname:pLayerName is the name of a layer, the device extensions
provided by that layer are returned.
