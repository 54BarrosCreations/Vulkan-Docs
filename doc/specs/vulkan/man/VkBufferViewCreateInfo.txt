VkBufferViewCreateInfo(3)
=========================

Name
----
VkBufferViewCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created buffer view

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkBufferViewCreateInfo - Structure specifying parameters of a newly created buffer view

The sname:VkBufferViewCreateInfo structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkBufferViewCreateInfo.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:flags is reserved for future use.
  * pname:buffer is a sname:VkBuffer on which the view will be created.
  * pname:format is a elink:VkFormat describing the format of the data
    elements in the buffer.
  * pname:offset is an offset in bytes from the base address of the buffer.
    Accesses to the buffer view from shaders use addressing that is relative
    to this starting offset.
  * pname:range is a size in bytes of the buffer view. If pname:range is
    equal to ename:VK_WHOLE_SIZE, the range from pname:offset to the end of
    the buffer is used. If ename:VK_WHOLE_SIZE is used and the remaining
    size of the buffer is not a multiple of the element size of
    pname:format, then the nearest smaller multiple is used.
