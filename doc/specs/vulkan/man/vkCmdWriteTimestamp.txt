vkCmdWriteTimestamp(3)
======================

Name
----
vkCmdWriteTimestamp - Write a device timestamp into a query object.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCmdWriteTimestamp Write a device timestamp into a query object.

To request a timestamp, call:

include::../protos/vkCmdWriteTimestamp.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be
    recorded.
  * pname:pipelineStage is one of the elink:VkPipelineStageFlagBits,
    specifying a stage of the pipeline.
  * pname:queryPool is the query pool that will manage the timestamp.
  * pname:query is the query within the query pool that will contain the
    timestamp.


Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdWriteTimestamp latches the value of the timer when all previous
commands have completed executing as far as the specified pipeline stage,
and writes the timestamp value to memory. When the timestamp value is
written, the availability status of the query is set to available.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
If an implementation is unable to detect completion and latch the timer at
any specific stage of the pipeline, it may: instead do so at any logically
later stage.
====

flink:vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults can: then be called to copy the timestamp
value from the query pool into buffer memory, with ordering and
synchronization behavior equivalent to how other queries operate. Timestamp
values can: also be retrieved from the query pool using
flink:vkGetQueryPoolResults. As with other queries, the query must: be reset
using flink:vkCmdResetQueryPool before requesting the timestamp value be
written to it.

While fname:vkCmdWriteTimestamp can: be called inside or outside of a render
pass instance, flink:vkCmdCopyQueryPoolResults must: only be called outside
of a render pass instance.
