VkCommandPool - Opaque handle to a command pool object

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkCommandPool - Opaque handle to a command pool object

Command pools are opaque objects that command buffer memory is allocated
from, and which allow the implementation to amortize the cost of resource
creation across multiple command buffers. Command pools are
application-synchronized, meaning that a command pool mustnot: be used
concurrently in multiple threads. That includes use via recording commands
on any command buffers allocated from the pool, as well as operations that
allocate, free, and reset command buffers or the pool itself.

Command pools are represented by sname:VkCommandPool handles:
