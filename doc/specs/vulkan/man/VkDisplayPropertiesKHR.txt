VkDisplayPropertiesKHR(3)
=========================

Name
----
VkDisplayPropertiesKHR - Structure describing an available display device

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkDisplayPropertiesKHR - Structure describing an available display device

The sname:VkDisplayPropertiesKHR structure is defined as:

include::../../api/structs/VkDisplayPropertiesKHR.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:display is a handle that is used to refer to the display described
    here. This handle will be valid for the lifetime of the Vulkan
    instance.
  * pname:displayName is a pointer to a NULL-terminated string containing
    the name of the display. Generally, this will be the name provided by
    the display's EDID. It can: be `NULL` if no suitable name is available.
  * pname:physicalDimensions describes the physical width and height of the
    visible portion of the display, in millimeters.
  * pname:physicalResolution describes the physical, native, or preferred
    resolution of the display.


Description
-----------

[NOTE]
.Note
====
For devices which have no natural value to
return here, implementations should: return the maximum resolution
supported.
====

  * pname:supportedTransforms tells which transforms are supported by this
    display. This will contain one or more of the bits from
    sname:VkSurfaceTransformFlagsKHR.
  * pname:planeReorderPossible tells whether the planes on this display can:
    have their z order changed. If this is ename:VK_TRUE, the application
    can: re-arrange the planes on this display in any order relative to each
    other.
  * pname:persistentContent tells whether the display supports
    self-refresh/internal buffering. If this is true, the application can:
    submit persistent present operations on swapchains created against this
    display.

[NOTE]
.Note
====
Persistent presents may: have higher latency, and may: use less power when
the screen content is updated infrequently, or when only a portion of the
screen needs to be updated in most frames.
