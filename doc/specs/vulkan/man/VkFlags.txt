VkFlags(3)
==========

Name
----
VkFlags - Vulkan bitmasks

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkFlags - Vulkan bitmasks

A collection of flags is represented by a bitmask using the type
basetype:VkFlags:

include::../api/basetypes/VkFlags.txt[]


Description
-----------

Bitmasks are passed to many commands and structures to compactly represent
options, but basetype:VkFlags is not used directly in the API. Instead, a
etext:Vk*Flags type which is an alias of basetype:VkFlags, and whose name
matches the corresponding etext:Vk*FlagBits that are valid for that type, is
used. These aliases are described in the <<boilerplate-flags,Flag Types>>
appendix of the Specification.

// refEnd VkFlags VkColorComponentFlags
