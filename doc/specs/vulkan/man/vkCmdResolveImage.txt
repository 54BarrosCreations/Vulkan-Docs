vkCmdResolveImage(3)
====================

Name
----
vkCmdResolveImage - Resolve regions of an image.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCmdResolveImage Resolve regions of an image.

To resolve a multisample image to a non-multisample image, call:

include::../api/protos/vkCmdResolveImage.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be
    recorded.
  * pname:srcImage is the source image.
  * pname:srcImageLayout is the layout of the source image subresources for
    the resolve.
  * pname:dstImage is the destination image.
  * pname:dstImageLayout is the layout of the destination image subresources
    for the resolve.
  * pname:regionCount is the number of regions to resolve.
  * pname:pRegions is a pointer to an array of slink:VkImageResolve
    structures specifying the regions to resolve.


Description
-----------

During the resolve the samples corresponding to each pixel location in the
source are converted to a single sample before being written to the
destination. If the source formats are floating-point or normalized types,
the sample values for each pixel are resolved in an implementation-dependent
manner. If the source formats are integer types, a single sample's value is
selected for each pixel.

pname:srcOffset and pname:dstOffset select the initial x, y, and z
offsets in texels of the sub-regions of the source and destination image
data. pname:extent is the size in texels of the source
image to resolve in pname:width, pname:height and pname:depth. 1D images use
only pname:x and pname:width. 2D images use pname:x, pname:y, pname:width
and pname:height. 3D images use pname:x, pname:y, pname:z, pname:width,
pname:height and pname:depth.

Resolves are done layer by layer starting with pname:baseArrayLayer member
of pname:srcSubresource for the source and pname:dstSubresource for the
destination. pname:layerCount layers are resolved to the destination image.
