VkBufferMemoryBarrier(3)
========================

Name
----
VkBufferMemoryBarrier - Structure specifying the parameters of a buffer memory barrier.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin VkBufferMemoryBarrier Structure specifying the parameters of a buffer memory barrier.

The sname:VkBufferMemoryBarrier structure is defined as:

include::../structs/VkBufferMemoryBarrier.txt[]


Members
-------

  * pname:sType is the type of this structure.
  * pname:pNext is `NULL` or a pointer to an extension-specific structure.
  * pname:srcAccessMask is a bitmask of the classes of memory accesses
    performed by the first set of commands that will participate in
    the dependency.
  * pname:dstAccessMask is a bitmask of the classes of memory accesses
    performed by the second set of commands that will participate in
    the dependency.
  * pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex is the queue family that is relinquishing
    ownership of the range of pname:buffer to another queue, or
    ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED if there is no transfer of ownership.
  * pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex is the queue family that is acquiring
    ownership of the range of pname:buffer from another queue, or
    ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED if there is no transfer of ownership.
  * pname:buffer is a handle to the buffer whose backing memory is affected
    by the barrier.
  * pname:offset is an offset in bytes into the backing memory for
    pname:buffer; this is relative to the base offset as bound to the buffer
    (see flink:vkBindBufferMemory).
  * pname:size is a size in bytes of the affected area of backing memory for
    pname:buffer, or ename:VK_WHOLE_SIZE to use the range from pname:offset
    to the end of the buffer.
