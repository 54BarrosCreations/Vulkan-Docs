vkGetDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR(3)
===================================

Name
----
vkGetDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR - Query capabilities of a mode and plane combination

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkGetDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR - Query capabilities of a mode and plane combination

Applications that wish to present directly to a display must: select which
layer, or "plane" of the display they wish to target, and a mode to use with
the display.  Each display supports at least one plane.  The capabilities of
a given mode and plane combination are determined by calling:

include::../api/protos/vkGetDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:physicalDevice is the physical device associated with
    pname:display
  * pname:mode is the display mode the application intends to program when
    using the specified plane. Note this parameter also implicitly specifies
    a display.
  * pname:planeIndex is the plane which the application intends to use with
    the display, and is less than the number of display planes supported by
    the device.
  * pname:pCapabilities is a pointer to a
    slink:VkDisplayPlaneCapabilitiesKHR structure in which the capabilities
    are returned.
