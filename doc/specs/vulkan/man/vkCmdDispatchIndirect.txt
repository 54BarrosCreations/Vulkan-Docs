vkCmdDispatchIndirect(3)
========================

Name
----
vkCmdDispatchIndirect - Dispatch compute work items using indirect parameters.

C Specification
---------------

// refBegin vkCmdDispatchIndirect Dispatch compute work items using indirect parameters.

To record an indirect command dispatch, call:

include::../protos/vkCmdDispatchIndirect.txt[]


Parameters
----------

  * pname:commandBuffer is the command buffer into which the command will be
    recorded.
  * pname:buffer is the buffer containing dispatch parameters.
  * pname:offset is the byte offset into pname:buffer where parameters
    begin.


Description
-----------

fname:vkCmdDispatchIndirect behaves similarly to flink:vkCmdDispatch except
that the parameters are read by the device from a buffer during execution.
The parameters of the dispatch are encoded in a
slink:VkDispatchIndirectCommand structure taken from pname:buffer starting
at pname:offset.
