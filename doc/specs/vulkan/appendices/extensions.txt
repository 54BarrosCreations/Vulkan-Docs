[[extensions]]
= Layers & Extensions

Extensions to the Vulkan API can: be defined by authors, groups of
authors, and the Khronos Vulkan Working Group. In order not to compromise
the readability of the Vulkan Specification, the core Specification does
not incorporate most extensions. The online registry of extensions is
available at URL

http://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/

and allows generating versions of the Specification incorporating different
extensions.

Most of the content previously in this appendix does not specify *use* of
specific Vulkan extensions and layers, but rather specifies the processes by
which extensions and layers are created. As of version 1.0.21 of the Vulkan
Specification, this content has been migrated to the <<vulkan-styleguide,
Vulkan Documentation and Extensions>>
document. Authors creating extensions and layers must: follow the mandatory
procedures in that document.
