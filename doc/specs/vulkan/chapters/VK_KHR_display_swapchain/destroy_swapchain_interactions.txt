If a swapchain associated with a display surface is destroyed and there are
no valid descendants of that swapchain, the implementation must: either
revert any display resources modified by presenting images with the
swapchain to their state prior to the first present performed with the
swapchain and its ancestors, or leave such resources in their current state.
